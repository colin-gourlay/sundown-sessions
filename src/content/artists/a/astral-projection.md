## About

Electronic musical group producing psychedelic trance and goa trance music, based in Israel.

The majority of their releases have been done through their own record company, [L=Trust in Trance] (which later merged with Phonokol). In addition to an extensive discography, the group has an extensive worldwide touring schedule. Some of Astral Projection's most well-known tracks are "Kabalah", "People Can Fly", "Mahadeva” and “Dancing Galaxy".

A precursor to Astral Projection, SFX, was formed in Israel in 1989 and originally consisted of Avi Nissim and Lior Perlmutter. They released a hit single in 1991 named Monster Mania, which prompted them to start working on an album. Work was halted when they decided to travel to New York and try their luck there. While Avi soon went back home, Lior stayed in the USA. In 1993, with Lior still in the US, Avi teamed up with Yaniv Haviv and Guy Sabbag and they released the single Another World.
In early 1994, Lior returned to Israel to work on his material with the group and they started releasing under their new label Trust in Trance. Guy soon left this group and the remaining members eventually changed their name to Astral Projection.
Yan-Iv Haviv left the group after the second album, it has been a duo since.
