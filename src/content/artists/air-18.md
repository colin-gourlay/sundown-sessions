## About

Dreamed up in 1967, Blue Air was the brainchild of Al Gwyllt, a precocious, piano-trained Ypsilanti, MI, songwriter. Richard Nisbet on bass and drumless drummer Scott Carter soon joined. After shortened the name to Air they performed more than 150 shows, in nearby Ann Arbor and Jackson, Michigan, plus Midwest towns much further afield. In 1972 the band recorded and released its only one single which was pressed 500 copies. Disbanded in 1974.
