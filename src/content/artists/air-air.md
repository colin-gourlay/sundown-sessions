## About

Air & Air is an instrumental rock band from Bangladesh, released first album 'A Time To Break The Silence' both at home and internationally.

The band is made up of five musicians from different musical acts around the city of Dhaka. The founder and the heart of the band, guitar soloist Zubair Bin Shahjahan, had previously worked with many local artists. His idea of an instrumental project originated in 2006 from his long-term collaboration with Omair Khan Panni, guitarist of the rock band "Breach". This was later expanded into a full-fledged Instrumental Rock act, and the two eventually recruited a proficient lineup, including Faiaz Hassan Chowdhury (from Breach) as the drummer, Adnan Atique (from Eclipse) as the keyboardist, and Aldnane Alam (from Kral, X-Factor & Arbovirus) as the bass player.

To distinguish from "guitar instrumental" acts in Bangladesh, Air & Air's work is defined by the blend of unique expressions that come from exquisite works of guitars, keyboards, bass and drums. Teeming with variety, technical prowess and illusive ambience, each instrumental song is specially handcrafted to take the listener on a profound musical journey.
