## About

Aloi Head and the Victor Motors were born in the mid 80’s out of Rob Craw, and his brother Al. Rob’s band at the time, the Huxton Creepers, were the hottest ticket in town, the next big thing. Rob and Al began jamming with mates of Al’s: Victor E. Gugger on bass and Mark “The King” Johnstone on drums. An extraordinarily basic rhythm section. The King has the loudest voice of any drummer anywhere. He claims that when he sings the insides of his head shake. Jonnie von Goes, who for years has been the voice of RRR on Sunday afternoons, wanted to be a part of it and elbowed his way in to those sessions. He didn’t exactly hip and shoulder Rob out. The Huxton Creepers were more than a full time thing. JVG quit the Hollowmen to join Aloi Head and as a result the Hollowmen went from strength to strength. The first gig Aloi Head and the Victor Motors played was at the Middle Park Hotel. The sound bloke for that gig was Mal Stanley who now presents Jazztrack on ABC Classic FM.
