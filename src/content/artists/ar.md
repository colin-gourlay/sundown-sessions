## About

Aïr started as a guitar & drums freeform experimental & noise duo in 1996, publishing a 7" (aareton-label) in the process. Gradually it evolved into a quartet, taking influence from Japanese psychedelic underground free rock and krautrock among other styles, made some gigs and recorded sounds around the millenium. At some point other things took over, and the band graduallly came to a halt.
