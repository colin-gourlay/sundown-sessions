Her first single "[url=https://www.discogs.com/master/1574747-Billie-Eilish-Ocean-Eyes]Ocean Eyes[/url]" was released in 2016 when she was 14 years old.
She released her E.P. "[url=https://www.discogs.com/master/1240011-Billie-Eilish-Dont-Smile-At-Me]Dont Smile At Me[/url]" in August 2017 and her first album "[url=https://www.discogs.com/master/1524311-Billie-Eilish-When-We-All-Fall-Asleep-Where-Do-We-Go]When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?[/url]" in March 2019, which would go on to become a phenomenal success for the 17-year-old artist.
Her downtempo second album, "[url=https://www.discogs.com/master/2234794-Billie-Eilish-Happier-Than-Ever]Happier Than Ever[/url]", released in July 2021, delves into self-reflection of the rise-to-fame she faced in her previous album and the downsides of stardom that came with it.
