## About

Black was a music project from the UK.

Punk band "The Epileptic Tits" evolved into "Tilt", and ultimately to "Black" in 1981: Colin Vearncombe (vocals), Dane Goulding (bass) and Greg Leyland (drums). David Dickie (aka Dave Dix) joined the band on keyboards and guitar later in 1981. By 1982 only Colin Vearncombe and David Dickie remained in the band, and after 1983 Black became a solo project of Colin Vearncombe, while Dave "Dix" Dickie became a co-writer and co-producer. Vearncombe died on January 26, 2016, from complications following an automobile accident.
