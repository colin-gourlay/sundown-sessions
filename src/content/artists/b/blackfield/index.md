## About

Collaboratory musical group between [a227943] and [a357431]. Blackfield temporarily became Geffen-led with Wilson taking a more passive role for "Blackfield IV" (2013), with his involvement as a contributor rather than a member. But Wilson resumed a full partnership with Geffen on Blackfield V (2016). Band members are drummer Tomer Z, bassist Seffy Efrati, and keyboardist Eran Mitelman. Former band members include Chris Maitland (replaced by Tomer Z, 2004) and Daniel Salomon (replaced by Eran Mitelman, 2007).

### Current Lineup

Steven Wilson, Aviv Geffen, Seffy Efrati, Eran Mitelman, Tomer Z
