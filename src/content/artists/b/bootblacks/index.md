## About

Bootblacks is a Brooklyn-based post-punk band that was formed in 2010. The current lineup of the band consists of Panther Almqvist on vocals, Barrett Hiatt on synth, and Kalle Fagerberg on guitar.

Bootblacks' sound is characterized by its brooding and atmospheric melodies, driving rhythms, and Almqvist's emotive vocals. The band draws inspiration from the post-punk and darkwave movements of the 1980s, but also incorporates contemporary elements of electronic music into their sound.

Since their formation, Bootblacks have released several critically acclaimed albums, including "Veins" (2016), "Fragments" (2018), and "Thin Skies" (2020). The band has also toured extensively throughout North America and Europe, performing at renowned venues and festivals.

With the addition of Fagerberg, Bootblacks are looking to explore new sonic territories and expand their already formidable musical horizons. Fans can look forward to more exciting music and performances from the band in the years to come.
