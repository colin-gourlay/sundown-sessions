## About

Bauhaus was a five-piece fusion set from the early 70s who never released an album until the live 'in-studio' recording "Stairway to Escher" was pressed by Akarma in 2003. Three of their musicians (guitarist Luigi Calabr√≤, bassist Paolo Damiani and drummer Rino Sangiorgio) had been members of [a1812837]. However, Bauhaus style is different, it is instrumental and more jazz-oriented.
