## About

Before The Fall Started out with Gino, Mick, And Brian growing up together in Arlington TX Playing in various bands all through junior high and high school. They decided to start jamming as a whole and focus on one band but Brian had enlisted in the Marines which in return sent him into war. Meanwhile Gino and Mick were still playing having people fill in while Brian was fighting for our country. As Brian returned home safely they gladly welcomed him back into the group finally creating Before The Fall. After a few years of playing and in need of a new drummer they finally came across Chris Vecchio (formerly of The Charismatics). With Before The Fall Complete they have set out on 3 national tours and a International Tour To Costa Rica sharing the stage with bands of all sorts.

Some of those bands include:

Bleed The Dream (Warcon Records)
Alesana (Fearless Records)
The Secret Handshake (Triple Crown Records)
Sky Eats Airplane (Equal Vision Records)
Kessler (YMA Records)
Ivoryline (Tooth And Nail Records)

And Headlining such festivals as:

Journeys Backyard BBQ (Dallas)
