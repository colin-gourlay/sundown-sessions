## About

Blacklisters aka BLKLSTRS are a noise rock band from Leeds, UK.

Blacklisters formed in 2008, quickly earning a reputation as a formidable live act through aggressive, confrontational performances riddled with dark humour, and drawing comparisons to The Jesus Lizard and Pissed Jeans.

In 2009 they released the Swords 7”, on Best Enemies Records, and in 2010 the Belt Party EP on Childhood Sweetheart Records. Their reputation continued to grow as they toured with the likes of Kong and Pulled Apart by Horses and played incendiary sets at the Leeds and Reading Festivals.

Their debut album BLKLSTRS was released in 2012 on the now defunct Leeds label Brew Records, resulting in praise from the likes of Kerrang, NME, Rock Sound, The Quietus, Loud & Quiet, Artrocker, Rock A Rolla and Drowned in Sound, as well as an invitation to record a live session at Maida Vale studios for the Radio 1 Rock Show.

Adult, their second album, was released in 2015 on the Small Town America label in the UK and on the A Tant Rêver Du Roi label in Europe. The album demonstrated a growing confidence in their song writing and performance, from abstract art-noise to the unrelenting, brutally minimalist riffs that first put them on the radar.

Blacklisters have headlined tours in the UK and Europe, and toured with the likes of Scratch Acid, Pig Destroyer, Future of the Left, Big Business and Flipper.

Steven Hodson (USA Nails, Kong) joined the band in 2017, replacing original bass player Owen Griffiths. Steven joined Billy Mason Wood (Vocals), Dante Beesley (Guitar) and Alistair Stobbart (Drums). That year they released a 7” single on the Too Pure Singles Club, recording live at Greenmount Studios in Leeds.
