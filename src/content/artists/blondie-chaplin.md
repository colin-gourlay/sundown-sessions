## About

South African singer and guitarist.

Born 7 July 1951 in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa

Terence William 'Blondie' Chaplin is a musician who first became known to international audiences through his brief stint in the early 1970s as a singer and guitarist for the Beach Boys. Chaplin was also listed as a co-producer, sang lead vocals with fellow South African musician Ricky Fataar (drummer) and composed, with Fataar, "Here She Comes" and "Hold On Dear Brother" on the twenty-third official Beach Boys album, "Carl and the Passions - 'So Tough'", released in 1972. He is well known in recent years as a long term backing vocalist and acoustic rhythm guitarist for the Rolling Stones.

Blondie Chaplin, along with drummer Ricky Fataar, joined the Beach Boys when original drummer Dennis Wilson suffered a hand injury which left him unable to play the drums for almost two years. For the Beach Boys, it was a period in which long-time member Bruce Johnston had departed the band, and one-time leader Brian Wilson's participation in the group was very limited. As a result, Chaplin and Fataar joined the Beach Boys as full-fledged members and not merely as backing musicians. Chaplin left the group in 1973 after a dispute with the Beach Boys' management; Fataar remained with the band until the following year.

Both Chaplin and Fataar were members of South African rock band the Flame before joining The Beach Boys. The Flame were discovered by Beach Boy Carl Wilson while performing in London. Wilson signed the band to the Beach Boys' Brother Records label and produced their self-titled album which featured soulful rock/pop songs in the vein of The Beach Boys and Badfinger. The Flame were the only band aside from The Beach Boys to record for Brother Records.

Chaplin sang lead on at least three Beach Boys songs, "Sail On, Sailor," "Leaving This Town" and "Funky Pretty" (all from the 1973 album Holland). During the late 1980s Chaplin toured with The Band, replacing some of Richard Manuel's vocals and playing guitar. Chaplin was also a featured player in former Byrds men Gene Clark and Michael Clarke's new band, titled "The 20th Anniversary Celebration of the Byrds". Chaplin then appeared on the Jennifer Warnes albums The Hunter and The Well. Since the late 1990s and the Bridges to Babylon Tour, Chaplin has been a backing vocalist and occasional guitar player for The Rolling Stones.

Chaplin has released three solo albums, most recently Between Us in 2006.
