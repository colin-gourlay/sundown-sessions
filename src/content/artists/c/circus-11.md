## About

British prog-band from late-60's.
In mid-60s Phillip Goodhand-Tait formed The Stormsville Shakers, a soul outfit with some singles issued in 1966. In the same year Mel Collins joined the band. A year later they renamed Circus following the "blow-up" of the psychedelic revolution. Two singles produced by Manfred Mann’s singer Mike D’Arbo in 1967 failed to chart. But their song “Gone Are The Songs Of Yesterday” was covered by Love Affair on the flip side of their hit single “Everlasting Love”. When Goodhand-Tait left to write more material for Love Affair, Circus decided to move away from the singles market and go into more experimental territory, developing a jazz fusion style. At this time the band consisted of Ian Jeffs on guitar and vocals, drummer Alan Bunn, bass player Kirk Riddle and renowned sax and flute player Mel Collins. In April 1969, Circus began a residency at The Marquee along with Keith Tippet's group, John Surman's group ​and the newly formed King Crimson. After signing with Transatlantic Records and just two weeks before the recording, the drummer Alan Bunn was replaced by Chris Burrows. Circus entered Morgan Studios with producer Ray Singer who had achieved success with Ray Sarstedt’s hit “ Where Do You Go To My Lovely.” The album was recorded in just two days. In early 1970 Mel Collins joined King Crimson and the group inevitably dissolved.
