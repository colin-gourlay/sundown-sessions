## About

Current Social Networks Bio:  Circadian Delays is the slightly curiously deceptive, audio/visual, neo tech ambient brain fog of Huitfeldt Gilmour, a persona of Cato / Cato Gilmour, aka schwarzmodul aka One Carrera Two aka Eccotonic.  It's a sometimes sunnier, more diverse musical jacket, yet inevitably drenched in melancholia. The first official, solo release appears here and everywhere else in July 2021. Recent collaborators include Foam And Sand ("Circle 21" from "Full Circle"), Wendy Rae Fowler (the “Hollow Ground” and “The Sound Of My Heart” remixes, the latter for which Circadian Delays also produced the video), Kira Skov (remix) and several collaborations with sublime video artist Francesca Ruth Levi.

Cato is a composer of music for film (Stone, Smokin' Aces, Mini's First Time, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps), and documentaries (The Kennedy Detail) and other media (incl. 1,300+ movie trailers), and a recording artist releasing as Circadian Delays, One Carrera Two, Eccotonic and Cato Gilmour (Kiite Records) and schwarzmodul (Track Number Records, Monkeytown Records).
