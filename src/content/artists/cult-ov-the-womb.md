## About

A short lived John Zewizz side project. Cult Ov The Womb (Initially called Cult Of The Womb) was a solo project of Sleep Chamber founder John Zewizz.  Cult of the womb released two cassettes and a few track on various artists releases between in late 1985 and 1986 all on Zewizz's Label XXX (Inner-X-Musick).  Cult Ov The Womb was non-musick.  Both full length cassette releases were collages of sound centered around TV news/shows clips about James Oliver Huberty and the San Ysidro McDonald's massacre, as well as VHS samples from porn movies and main stream movies like "Apocalypse Now" and "Taxi Driver".  Very little to no actual instruments were used.
