## About

Doves are an English indie rock band, formed in Manchester in 1998. The band is composed of twin brothers Jez (guitar, vocals) and Andy Williams (drums, vocals), and Jimi Goodwin (lead vocals, bass, guitar). Additionally, the band employs Martin Rebelski, as a touring and session musician on keyboards. The band released five studio albums between 2000 and 2020, three of which reached #1 on the UK album charts. A compilation album, The Places Between: The Best of Doves, was released in April 2010.
Doves went on hiatus in 2010. During this time, Goodwin released his first solo album, Odludek (2014), while the Williams brothers regrouped as Black Rivers. In December 2018, Doves announced they were ending their hiatus by performing for the Teenage Cancer Trust at London's Royal Albert Hall on 29 March 2019. Further festivals, including some dates with Noel Gallagher, were subsequently announced. The band released two new songs: "Carousels" and "Prisoners", in June and July 2020 respectively. Their fifth studio album The Universal Want was released in September 2020.
