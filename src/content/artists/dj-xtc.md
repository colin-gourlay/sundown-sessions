## About

Mark started his DJ-ing career at the tender age of 15 playing in places such as Sequins (Blackpool), Fantazia, Mythology and the legendary Hacienda, where in the late 80’s he won the North West DMC DJ Championships.

This is when he decided that DJ-ing was his life….

He then started producing his own music with his DJ group “The Mix Factory” (of Sunset 102fm) where his mix of the Mix Factory track “Take Me Away” reached number 41 in the UK singles chart and also gained some success in the American charts.

As well as producing he has DJ’ed all over the world for example annually in Malia, Ibiza, Brussels and across Europe for some awesome nights such as Helter Skelter, Dreamscape, The Eclipse, Pure X the legendary night in London, Movement and Fantazia.

Mark was also helping to spread the sound of music in the northwest by managing both Spin Inn and Eastern Bloc record shops.

This is when “DA INTALEX” was born. Two guys doing what they loved, producing and spinning Drum and Bass all around the world. DA INTALEX presented a Friday and Monday night drum and bass show on Kiss 102 which changed to Galaxy 102 from 1993-2000. DA INTALEX founded Intalex Recordings with tunes being brought out constantly, such as “I Like It Remix”. “New Dawn” was released on Jump Up Records and also “What You Gonna Do” on Flex, which has gone down in history as one of the “all time top ten drum and bass tunes”.

Sadly DA INTALEX went there separate ways but Mark signed to Dread Recordings/Penny Black Records with DJ Ray Keith releasing music such as the “Come On E.P” which gained mark interest from the mighty Dillinja himself who then signed mark to Valve/Beatz Recordings and released “Keyz” and “Roll Dem Beatz”.

Mark has also released tunes on many other labels including Moving Shadow, Integral, Hard Leaders, Penny Black and Dread.
