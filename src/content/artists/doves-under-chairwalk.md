## About

Doves Under Chairwalk changed their name to DUC in the early 90s for two reasons: The circumstance that the band sang only German lyrics was one, but the main reason was that they have changed their guitarist. From then on, his influence was gone but the band refused to be the same band. So they did not want to change their name completely but worked on under the shortcut of their previous name: DUC.
