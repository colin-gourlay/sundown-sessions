## About

Greek beat group. Singer and guitarist was [a1022004] aka [a1511346]. Their manager [a4347652], the later known politician and member of the Greek parliament, was also the composer of some of their tracks. Their single "The first gun" was one of the first songs that were banned by the junta censorship and so the band was forced to change the title to "The forest of my place".
