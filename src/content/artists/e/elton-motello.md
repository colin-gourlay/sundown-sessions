## About

Punk/new wave band with members of British proto-punk band Bastard, which was also fronted by Alan Ward. The group was formed in Brussels after Ward (and Bastard in his wake) had settled there. Apart from being the band name, Elton Motello was also used as a moniker by Ward. Please use Elton Motello (2) for such credits.
