## About

Electric Light Orchestra Part II was formed in 1988 by drummer [a448986], a founding member of the original [a112154], the successful progressive pop group led by frontman [a33843] from 1971 into the mid-1980s. After Lynne officially dissolved the band, Bevan assembled a new line-up including vocalist [a227362], keyboardist [a255788] and bassist [a328334] to tour under the Electric Light Orchestra banner; Lynne soon filed suit against the group, the resulting settlement appending the "Part II" tag to any new albums or live performances. Their self-titled debut LP followed in 1991; a year later they issued a live album featuring new renditions of their classic hits. 

ELO Part II was active from 1988â€“1999. Due to Bev Bevan selling his rights to the ELO name to Jeff Lynne the band could not continue under the name ELO Part II.
The remaining members, however, recruited drummer [a1220868] and decided to continue as [a1252896] who continue to tour up to the present day.
