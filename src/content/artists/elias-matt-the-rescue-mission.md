## About

Their sound is influenced by the „Sheffield Sound“ of the late 70s and early 80s with bands like The Human League and Cabaret Voltaire and German electronic acts such as Kraftwerk. The band almost exclusively uses analog synthesizers of this era. They see themselves as an art project with bizarre live performances, strange interviews and unusual promotion campaigns.
