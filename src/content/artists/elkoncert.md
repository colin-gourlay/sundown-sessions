## About

Slovakian agency.
Requiem for region/scenery Danube was the first Slovakian international rockfestival, whereby elóKONCERT agency began their organizing work. This programme produced important international impact  the whole Slovakian and worldwide professional sphere listened acknowledged it. Thanks to this reference we received immediate opportunitie to organize important Slovakian and international productions. This festival was followed by different concert tours, theatre performances, rock operas etc. 
In 1992 our agency organized the first slovakian concert of the group IRON MAIDEN in Bratislava. Our concert tours were organised in Slovakia, Czech Rebublic, Hungary and Austria.
