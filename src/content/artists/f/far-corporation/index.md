## About

Far Corporation were a multi-national band created by German record producer Frank Farian, who created the bands Boney M. and Milli Vanilli. The name was shortened from "Frank Farian Corporation", which was originally put together to record a cover of the Paul Simon piece "Mother and Child Reunion" as a charity record and reached the top 10 in several European countries. That group's lineup included members of Barclay James Harvest, Toto, Boney M and Force Majeure.
Far Corporation's primary claim to fame is their cover of "Stairway to Heaven". Contrary to public perception, Far Corporation was actually the first group to make the singles charts with this song as Led Zeppelin had never released it as a single. In fact, it was the only version of the song that charted on the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching #89 in October 1986. Some of the musicians Farian assembled included vocalist Robin McAuley, vocalist Henry Gorman, drummers Curt Cress and Peter Bold, and three members of Toto: vocalist Bobby Kimball, keyboardist David Paich, and guitarist Steve Lukather. Far Corporation released its first album Division One in 1985 on IMP/ATCO Records and their cover of "Stairway to Heaven" reached #8 on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached #9 in Ireland and the following year peaked at #16 in South Africa and number 23 in Australia.
Also included on the album was a cover of Free's "Fire and Water" (their second single). 
The band was promoted by a full playback performance at German TV ZDF in the show "Rockpop". The show was also attended by Robert Plant, who backstage congratulated Robin McAuley for his great performance. Some rehearsal shots were used for Puma sportswear commercials underlyied by "Live is Life" hit of the Austrian band Opus making the impression of FAR Corporation performing the Opus hit. 
A second album, Advantage was completed for a 1987 release, heralded by the new single "One by One". Both this as well as the second single - a cover of Cockney Rebel's "Sebastian" - failed to reach the charts, and the album was eventually scrapped. Two years later, another complete track, "She's Back Again", appeared on the soundtrack to the German TV show "Blaues Blut" in 1989. Two of the album's lost recordings, "Make Believe" and "Big Brother", surfaced as Bobby Kimball duets on Farian artist Jayne (Collins)'s Ambush in the Night album (1989) and Milli Vanilli's second album The Moment of Truth (1991). The rest, bar "One by One", were recycled along with a few new recordings on the group's second release, 1994's Solitude on MCI-BMG. This time they were joined by former Thin Lizzy and 21 Guns guitarist Scott Gorham; included on the album was a cover of the 21 Guns song "Just a Wish". Mostly assembled in honour of Farian's 25 years anniversary as a producer, the album failed to repeat the success of "Stairway to Heaven".
