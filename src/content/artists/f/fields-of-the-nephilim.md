## About

Formed in Stevenage, Hertfordshire (UK) in 1984. Fields Of The Nephilim were a distinctive goth rock band that incorporated psychedelic and progressive elements until their eventual split in 1991.

Following the split, vocalist Carl McCoy pursued his The Nefilim project. The remainder of the band began their new venture Rubicon (3), with vocalist Andy Delany.

In 1998 rumours of a Fields Of The Nephilim reunion were announced, but failed to see the light of day. In 2002 Jungle Records released a number of recordings without the consent of McCoy who regrouped and eventually produced the Mourning Sun album (2005).
