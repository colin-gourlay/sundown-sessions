## About

Formed in Stevenage, Hertfordshire (UK) in 1984. Fields Of The Nephilim were a distinctive goth rock band that incorporated psychedelic and progressive elements until their eventual split in 1991.

Following the split, vocalist [a=Carl McCoy] pursued his [a=The Nefilim] project. The remainder of the band began their new venture [a=Rubicon (3)], with vocalist [a=Andy Delany].

In 1998 rumours of a Fields Of The Nephilim reunion were announced, but failed to see the light of day. In 2002 Jungle Records released a number of recordings without the consent of McCoy who regrouped and eventually produced the Mourning Sun album (2005).
