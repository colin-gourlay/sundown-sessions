## About

Grinderman is an alternative rock band formed by Nick Cave (vocals, electric guitar, organ, piano), Warren Ellis (electric bouzouki, Mandocastor, violin, viola, acoustic guitar, backing vocals), Martyn P. Casey (bass, acoustic guitar, backing vocals) and Jim Sclavunos (drums, percussion, backing vocals) in London, United Kingdom in 2006. All members are also active musicians in [a36665] and the band, originally known as Mini Seeds, were formed as "a way to escape the weight of The Bad Seeds." The band's name is inspired by a Memphis Slim song, "Grinder Man Blues", which Cave is noted to have started singing during one of the band's early rehearsal sessions. Their self-titled debut album, Grinderman, was released in 2007 to extremely positive reviews and the band's sophomore studio album, Grinderman 2, released in 2010.
