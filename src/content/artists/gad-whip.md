## About

Gad Whip are mainly from Yorkshire, UK.

"Gad Whip fluently and forcefully create pictures and construct images of a certain sentimental charge, but without shedding a single tear. Itâ€™s poetic and postmodern. Humorous and tragic. A collection of what they hold close and consolidation of those instances when we crush things to dust and rebuild them better than before."
