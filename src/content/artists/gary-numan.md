## About

Born 8th of March 1958 in Hammersmith, London, England.

Started his musical career in 1977 as a punk rocker in the band [a=Mean Street], before being sacked in May 1977. He responded to an advert in Melody Maker to join the band The Lasers, alongside [a=Paul Gardiner]. Both soon left to form their own punk band, [a=Tubeway Army], with his uncle [a=Jess Lidyard] filling in on drums. 

In 1978 [a=Tubeway Army] was signed to [l=Beggars Banquet] and released a couple of punk singles. By then he was using the name Numan and the band was performing live in pubs and clubs around London, supporting [a263209]. Whilst recording demos for Beggars, Gary stumbled upon a "Minimoog," that had been left behind in the studio, still programmed to a sound that caught his attention.
