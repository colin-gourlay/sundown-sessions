## About

Alternative rock band from Greensboro, NC.
Geezer Lake straddled several genres, eschewed traditional song arrangements, and melded together elements of pop, rock, jazz, post-hardcore, metal, film scores, avant-garde, noise, sound-collage, and structured improvisation. Perhaps one of the most striking differences between Geezer Lake and other indie-rock acts was their use of reverb-drenched horns, played through amplifiers, adding an etherial aura to the typical guitar/bass/drum configuration. Geezer Lake was active from the late 80s through the late 90s, reforming briefly for a short tour in 2000.
