## About

Rose Melberg - Vocals, Guitar
Amy Linton - Drums, Vocals
Paul Curran - Bass, Vocals

Started in San Francisco, CA in 1995, Go Sailor was mainly a side project for Rose (The Softies, Tiger Trap, Gaze), Amy (Henry's Dress) and Paul (Crimpshrine). After 3 great singles and 2 tracks on compilations, Go Sailor called it quits in 1996, much to the chagrin of twee-popsters everywhere, in order for the members to focus on other projects. Later that year Lookout! Records released all their songs on one CD.
