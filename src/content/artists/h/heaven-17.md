## About

Formed as a side project of the British Electric Foundation (B.E.F.), the production company formed by Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware, after their departure from the The Human League in 1980. Known for hit singles such as Temptation & Let Me Go.

The name "Heaven 17" is derived from Stanley Kubrick's movie "A Clockwork Orange", where Heaven 17 is mentioned as one of the hip bands in the record store scene.
