## About

Heaven 17 are an English synth-pop band formed in Sheffield in 1980. The band were a trio for most of their career, composed of founding Human League members Martyn Ware (keyboards, drum machine, vocals) and Ian Craig Marsh (keyboards) with vocalist Glenn Gregory.
Although most of their music was recorded in the 1980s, they have occasionally reformed, and played their first live concerts in 1997.
