## About

Gared O'Donnell laid waste for ten years with PLANES MISTAKEN FOR STARS. Alongside this monolithic band, he was sequestered in his down time, haha, working on new ideas. These ideas slowly took shape and became HAWKS AND DOVES. The first evidence was the closing track on the final PMFS album. A haunting, eerie heart stopper that the band demanded be fleshed out and added to the album. At points, H&D has been Gared alone, acoustic in hands, blue-eyed soul through a belt sander. Along the way, Gared has recorded in different parts of the country with various friends, people he had played with past and present. This record sets the tone, but I guarantee the upcoming album with drop you, roundhoused. The A-side is the full-band version of "Hush Money", which includes two PMFS alumni: Mongo on the drums and original bass player Aaron, pulled out of retirement. (An acoustic version of this song was included on the FREE compilation THE FEST 7.) The B-side is a haunting Bruce Springsteen cover, recorded in Gainesville with Matt Sweeting on bass (Assholeparade, Strikeforce Diablo), Chad Darby on guitar (Averkiou), and Danny Welsh on drums (Army of Ponch). The future? H&D is in the middle of recording an album. Gared has recruited George Rebelo (Hot Water Music) on drums and Chad Darby (Averkiou) on bass, guitar, and reverb. Special guests have contributed vocals, cello, and the like as well. You have been warned! --Var.
