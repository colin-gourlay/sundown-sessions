## About

Rock band from Auckland, New Zealand formed in 1975.

Their debut, self-titled album is regarded as a New Zealand classic. Despite breakups, and solo careers Hello Sailor continued to tour and perform in the second decade of the 21st Century until the passing of Dave McArtney (2013) and Graham Brazier (2015).
