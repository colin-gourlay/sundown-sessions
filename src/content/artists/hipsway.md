Scottish pop/new wave band formed in Glasgow in 1984 by ex-Altered Images guitarist Johnny McElhone on bass, and featuring Grahame Skinner (vocals), Pim Jones (guitar) and Harry Travers (drums). They split up in 1990 and reformed in 2016 for a pair of shows in Glasgow to celebrate the re-release of their first album.
