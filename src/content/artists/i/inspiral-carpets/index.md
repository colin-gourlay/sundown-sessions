## About

Inspiral Carpets is an English rock band, part of the late-1980s/early-1990s Madchester movement. Formed in Oldham in 1983, the band's most successful lineup featured frontman Tom Hingley, drummer Craig Gill, guitarist Graham Lambert, bassist Martyn Walsh and keyboardist Clint Boon. 
Several line-ups were loosely used from 1980 until Lambert and singer Stephen Holt met at The Moor End indie disco in Oldham in 1983. Holt sang on the first two independent singles. Holt departed the band before they signed with Mute Records, Inspiral Carpets are known for using organs and distorted guitars with influences from psychedelic rock.  In 2011, Hingley departed the band, though members disagree about the circumstances. The band continued, reuniting with Holt. Inactive since Gill's death in 2016, on 17 October 2022 the band announced they would be reforming and going on a tour of the UK in March and April 2023.
