## About

Before jazz pianist Esbjörn Svensson and fellow musicians Dan Berglund on bass and Magnus Öström on drums got down to business as e.s.t. revolutionizing the jazz world by redefining the piano trio format, they recorded an album together with Magnus Broo (tr), Per Texas Johansson and Fredrik Ljungström (both sax) under the name "Jazz Furniture". Four of the nine tracks are by e.s.t. musicians, including two early tracks by Svensson, who died while diving in 2008.
