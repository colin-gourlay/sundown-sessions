## About

British indie-rock band formed by Crispian Mills and Alonza Bevan whilst at college in 1988.  Various lineup and name changes (previous members included one of Hayley Mills' ex-boyfriends on vocals and previous monikers the band went under included The Kays and [a12672059]), plus thanks to Crispian's pilgrimage in 1993, they are famously tinged with an Eastern-fused sound because of Crispian's Hinduism influences.  

They originally split in 1999 amid personality clashes, record company intrusion and frustration of competing against the press' infamous lynching towards Crispian after some misinterpreted quotes in 1997.  Crispian went on to record a project called Pi (the material never materialised) and The Jeevas. Alonza joined Johnny Marr's band Healers (2) and formed a short-lived band with Paul Winter-Hart called Shep.  Winter-Hart also joined the short-lived Thirteen:13 and drummed for Aqualung.  Jay Darlington joined Oasis (2) as a live and session musician and carried on with Beady Eye when they split in 2009.

In 2002 a compilation was released entitled "Kollected", which Crispian compiled and wrote sleeve notes for.  It also featured a previously unreleased Bob Dylan cover, which was also the band's final recorded song before their split. 

In 2004 the band "reformed" for a one-off song "Braj Mandala" on a charity compilation album 'School of Braja' which Crispian had been creative director of, also recording two new songs with The Jeevas too.  Crispian laid down the basics of the song and asked the other members individually to play their parts on it.  (Jay was the only member not to be involved due to his commitments with Oasis (2)).  Crispian and Alonza soon began writing together again and planned a full return. Jamming in the studio birthed the "Revenge of the King" E.P. and a supporting mini-tour in 2005.   

Harry Broadbent was hired in 2006 and officially became Jay's replacement.  

On 7th December 2022, Kula Shaker tweeted that original keyboardist Jay Darlington is back, and will be playing with them on tour.

On September 28, 2023, Kula Shaker announced that their forthcoming 7th studio album will be titled "Natural Magick", released on January 26, 2024. The album will be the first since Peasants, Pigs & Astronauts to feature original keyboardist Jay Darlington.
