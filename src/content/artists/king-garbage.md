## About

King Garbage are the new crop of American soul players, the Muscle Shoals Swampers of the file-sharing generation from Asheville, North Carolina! Zach Cooper and Vic DiMotsis compose freewheeling and heartbreakingly endearing soul, embracing the roots of American music with Cheshire grins and a sound that's all their own.

Imagining the rhythm sections of Pino Palladino and Questlove amongst the vocals of Beth Gibbons or Sam Cooke will put you in the right headspace for King Garbage. Vic and Zach melt influence and experience with sheer joy, good humor and hearts full of friendship to burnish gems of dusted pop. The flexibility on display is maddening - from croon to four-top harmonization, from breaks full of grit to heavenly horn sections, Vic and Zach push themselves into new territory with each release, grinning and improvising their way from one corner of the country to the next. After twelve years of friendship and collaboration, the duo have learned to lean on each other and encourage forward motion no matter the outcome.
