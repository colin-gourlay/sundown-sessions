## About

American psychedelic rock group, formed in Los Angeles in 1965. They signed to Elektra records along with the Doors (who were influenced by them in their early days). After the original line-up split in early 1968, Arthur Lee continued to perform under the name “Love” until 1974, and subsequently irregularly until his death in 2006.
