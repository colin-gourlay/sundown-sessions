## About

Lepold "Paul" Gad has origins from Malta. His father's name was Nikolaos and his mother's name was Loukia. He was born in Malta in 1889 and had two sisters, Juliet and Virginie, and one brother, Antoine. Besides Paul, Virginie also studied music, since she was a soprano. Between the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century, his family settled in Ermoupoli of Syros island. In 1907 Paul left for Constantinople. He returned a few years later to marry his first wife, with whom he had no children, because she died very young in 1918. Paul returned back to Constantinople and married his second wife, Pelagia Vasileiadou, who was twenty years younger and hailed from Buca of Smyrna. With his new wife, they have two children, Elena and Nikolaos. Unfortunately, the latter died very young, at 43 year age. Elena Gad lived since 1962 in Germany and she never returned to Greece.

Paul Gad worked in Constantinople as a singer at various dance halls and collaborated with Greek musicians who traveled there, like [a937584], [a2734595] and [a1892745]. Between 1927 and 1929, he recorded several songs at various labels (English and Greek [l1866], German [l75860], German [l124849]) mainly in romantic genre, but also in folk and rebetiko genres.

In March 1964 Paul and his wife come to Greece, in order to settle in Ymittos, Athens. In the same year the rest of the family meet them in their new home.

Paul passed away in 1973. His wife passed away two years later, in 1975.
