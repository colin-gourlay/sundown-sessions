## About

In the year after their formation in 2008, Les Yeux Sans Visage – at that time still as a trio – released a 2-track single (Monument, 2009) and a 4-track EP (New Age, 2009) as 7inch singles. The editions of 500 copies each were quickly sold out – without national distribution and only through sales at concerts and by mail. In 2013, the critically acclaimed debut album «Tomorrow Is A Million Years» was released. Numerous club and festival concerts in Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland and Russia, as well as TV appearances followed. After a four-year break from concerts, the band reformed its lineup in 2018. A stage project in collaboration with the Lucerne Theater and a residency at the Südpol were followed by a few selected concerts. After that, Les Yeux Sans Visage focused on working on the new album «Choir Of The Desolate».
