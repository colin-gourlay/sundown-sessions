## About

Love and Rockets were an English alternative rock band formed in 1985 by former [a85897] members Daniel Ash (vocals, guitar and saxophone), David J (bass guitar and vocals) and Kevin Haskins (drums and synthesisers) after that group split in 1983. After performing in Toronto in April, 1999, Love and Rockets disbanded. They reformed in 2007 and played several concerts up until 2008. In an interview in June 2009, Ash emphatically stated that he had no further plans to play with Love and Rockets. This statement lasted until 2023.
