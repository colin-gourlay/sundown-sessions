## About

Formed in 2013, LOVE LOVE is the sound of two extremely talented singer-songwriters, joining together in life and music, to create songs that bring out the best in both artists. The debut is a lush, often darkly passionate mix of vocal-and-lyric-driven ’60s and ’70s-inspired rock, with two lead voices blending beautifully.

The core of LOVE LOVE is Chris Toppin on lead and backing vocals, acoustic and bass guitar; Jefferson Davis Riordan on lead and backing vocals, acoustic and electric guitar and drums, and Darren Ray on lead guitar. LOVE LOVE, the record also boasts many guest musicians from the rich Boston music scene and often adds a horn section and pedal steel to the mix.

Chris Toppin was co-founder of the 1990’s successful rock band, Fuzzy that were signed to Atlantic Records and toured extensively with The Lemonheads, Belly, and Dinosaur Jr. After taking a decade off to raise her children, Toppin rejoined the music scene while volunteering and becoming inspired by Girls Rock Camp Boston. “(They) gave me the courage to take the risk and leave my 9-5 job and start doing music again,” she said. “The past few years, I’ve had a transformation because of them. I owe them a lot.”

Toppin and Jefferson Davis Riordan (Evelyn Swoons, The Almightys) knew each other from singing back-up vocals and drumming, respectively, for others for years. She discovered that Riordan wrote and sang when he asked her to sing back up on one of his own songs. Fond of reflective love songs and murder ballads, Toppin and Riordan share songwriting credits for 13 of the 14 songs on the album.
