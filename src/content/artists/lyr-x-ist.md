## About

In 2003 Kalo/Are-tistik returned to Saskatoon to form the group Lyr-x-st with Atrium  and Aposle.  It happened on David Knight Cresent, outside of Atriums house, near his cucumber fields.  Lyr-x-ist released it first cd entitled Lyriks Exist in November 2003, creating a buzz around the city for its unique sound. Lyr-x-ist headlined various events and venues around Saskatoon such as the Odeon Events Centre and the Jazz Basement. Lyr-x-ist first public performance was headlining a fashion show. In August 2004, Lyr-x-ist released its first professionally pressed sophomore album entitled The Krossing.  Lyr-x-ist released the album to a capacity crowd at the Odeon Events Centre in March 2005. Opening for Lyr-X-ist was ‘Dro’ of Canadian rap group ‘Rezofficial’. To date this show remains one of the largest local talent hiphop shows in Saskatchewan history, and made the Odeon a respectable hiphop venue.  In the summer of 2005, Are-tis-tik, Atrium and Aposle, moved to Calgary to record their third studio album. Within 30 days they had recorded 32 songs. In August 2005, they released half of these songs on Chapter one: Riders of the North. This album received critical acclaim and international recognition in German magazines, being compared to fellow Canadian recording artists Swollen Members. Lyr-x-ist performed several shows in Saskatoon to promote the album at the Odeon Events Centre and Jazz Basement. Chapter 2 was released digitally.  The Final Chapter is completed and we hope to release it sometime.
