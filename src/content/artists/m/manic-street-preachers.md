## About

Rock group formed in Blackwood, Wales in the late 1980s: James Dean Bradfield (lead guitar, vocals), Nicky Wire (sometimes goes by his real surname Jones - bass), Sean Moore (drums), Richey Edwards (rhythm guitar). The last named of these has been missing presumed dead since 1995 and the remaining members have continued as a trio. Though they are a rock group with a heavy guitar sound, they have also been the subject of many remixes by electronic artists.
