## About

French electro-synth band composed of Dominique Regiacorte, Pierre Mastro, Veronique Olivier and Jean-Luc Drion (producer). They were most notable for their worldwide hit "Don Quichotte" which synth riff was sampled on Will.I.Am's "I Got It From My Mama" in which he needed to credit both members in his release.
