Taking their name from Black Sabbath's third album, Masters of Reality is a hard rock group formed in Syracuse, New York in 1981 by guitarist/singer Chris Goss and guitarist Tim Harrington (2). The band is sometimes associated with the "Palm Desert Scene", which includes Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age, and other stoner/desert rock bands. The band's lineup tends to be fluid with the exception of leader Goss.
