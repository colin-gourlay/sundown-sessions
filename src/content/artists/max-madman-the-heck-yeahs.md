## About

This is what a party band looks like in the 21st century. Energetic, poetic, chaotic, witty, visceral, aggressively DIY and defiant of a singular genre. Max Madman & The Heck Yeahs can't be found at the top of the charts and you don't want them to be. They exist only in this moment, for you. Before you know it they're gone in a drunken haze of synthesisers and boyish charm; a pastiche of musical styles resulting in a hurricane of joy. Don't blink or you'll miss it.
