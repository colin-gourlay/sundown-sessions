## About

A hip-hop MC originally from Philadelphia and now residing in Copenhagen, Denmark. 
The origin of the name is explained by Rahsheed in this quote from an interview in March of 2004: "Baby Blak actually called me Rah Maylay at first because I was total chaos and I spark a lot. So, Maylay Sparks it became."
