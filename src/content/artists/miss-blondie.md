## About

Miss Blondie's speed light evolution combined with her unique musical style, natural charisma, joy and dynamics in the dj booth seem to be her secret to success over the last 12 years!
Blondie makes it imperative to share with the crowd, in every single set, a bit of her, through an immense, positive and rich connection achieved through her personality and different musical influences.
Her style reflects her passion for music, so defining it is as complicated as explaining a great love... She travels from Nu-disco, deephouse, soulful, deep-tech, tech-house, techno and electronica, always keeping it filled with vocals, and with a characteristic Groove and a melodic, sexy vibe.
It was with this wide range musical style and great female intuition to control any dance floor that Blondie started to see her work getting recognition from the best Djs and Portuguese clubs to the worldwide clubbing scene, and even at the biggest festivals such as Rock in Rio, MTV Shakedown, Smirnoff Experience and Sunrise festival, playing for over 100,000 people.
You can check her out not only in Portugal, but also across the world, she as already performed in some of the best clubs in the 4 continents , Europe, America, Asia and Africa! This confessed workaholic dj, dancer and music lover finally took it to the next level, releasing her first EP with Dj Diego Miranda - " Black Diamond" for New Breed Records, her first remix : Pedro Saraiva feat Daniela Galbin “Hollywood” for Pandora Records and Kaos Records and her first original track –Groovin’ - by Asymmetric Recordings, remixed by the one and only Audiojunkies!... And is currently collaborating in some other projects with Jackspot and a few other producers.
Her true love for music and wide range versatility is shown in her experience in djing parallel areas such as writing her own monthly column for the biggest Portuguese dance scene magazine – DanceClub - interviewing some of the biggest names in production; producing and hosting 2 different TV shows : Conversas de Estúdio, and Backstage Blondie; and more recently, managing and teaching at ProDJ – DJ and Electronic Music Production Academy in Oporto.
Miss Blondie, definitely a name to remember!
