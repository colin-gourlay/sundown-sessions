## About

[b]Calle (Charlie) Häggqvist[/b] on vocal and bass. His father ([a2042887]?)was a manager at Sonet Records. Has been working as a sound engineer at a studio in Älvsjö.

[b]Roland Ebert[/b] on vocal and guitar. His grandad [a886437] was Jussi Björlings pianist. Has been working at the post office.

Calle met [b]Leif "Pålle" Paulsén[/b] (the bassplayer in Secret Service) many times, and all Calle talked about was Moby Dick. Eventually Calle convinced Pålle to visit a live gig at a youth center in Lidingö. It sounded bloody awful! But Pålle is a nice man and helped Calle and Roland, the result was [i]"My dreams are clear"[/i].

[b]Moby Dick[/b] have their own label, [b]Red House Records[/b]. The first release on this label was a band from Lidingö called [b]Ratfab[/b]. They got the sleeve designed by [b]Andy Warhol[/b]. Calle met Andy in New York, and it took Andy 30 seconds to draw the artwork.
