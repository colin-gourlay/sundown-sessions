## About

Moke Hill is the musical collaboration of Detroit natives Drew Phillips (vocals, guitar) and Ben Berry (vocals, guitar, keyboard), as their paths diverged from Los Angeles to Detroit to Chicago to northern California's gold country. The results are richly layered songs that are passionate in subject matter yet precise in musicianship. The duo united in Laurel Canyon to record their debut EP, enlisting the help of longtime friends Chris Reynolds (synths, percussion), Tim Hutton (bass) and Dash Hutton (drums). The band is currently based in Los Angeles.
