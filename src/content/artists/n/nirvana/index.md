## About

Rock band from Aberdeen, Washington, USA, formed in 1987. Emerging from the Seattle grunge scene of the late 1980s/early 1990s, Nirvana was a power trio of musicians who brought a new aesthetic to the rock scene of the time. They had already released their debut LP "Bleach" with Sub Pop, but their 1991 major-label debut for DGC/Geffen Records, "Nevermind" broke the band and grunge into the mainstream of America. Singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain's death by suicide in April 1994 brought the band to an end.

The band's names in a chronological order:
**Skid Row** (start (March 1987) - June 26, 1987)
**Pen Cap Chew** (June 27, 1987 - August 8, 1987)
**Bliss** (August 9, 1987 - January 1988)
**Ted Ed Fred** (January 1988 - March 18, 1988)
**Nirvana** (March 19, 1988 - end (April 5, 1994))

It was rumoured that there were two other short-used band names before Nirvana: **Throat Oyster** and **Windowpane** (_no official proofs for it though_)
