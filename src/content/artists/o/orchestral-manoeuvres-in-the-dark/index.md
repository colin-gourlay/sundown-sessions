## About

Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark (commonly known as OMD) is an English electronic band formed in Wirral, Merseyside, in 1978 with Paul Humphreys (synthesizers) and Andy McCluskey (vocals and bass guitar). Earlier incarnations of their band included 'VCL XI' and 'Hitlerz Underpantz'. They played their first gig in 1978 at Eric's (Liverpool), then had a run of UK chart hits after swapping labels from Factory to the Virgin owned label DinDisc starting with the 1980 release Messages. In 1980, drummer Malcolm Holmes and Dave Hughes on synths transitioned from guest / live musicians to be full members of the band. Hughes left 1980 and was replaced by Martin Cooper. Humphreys left the group in 1989.

McCluskey was allowed to keep the name and OMD made a comeback in 1991 with the UK top 5 hit Sailing On The Seven Seas, followed by a UK top 3 album (Sugar Tax). Until 2006-01-01 OMD was basically Andy McCluskey solo but on New Year's day McCluskey announced plans for a reunion. In 2007 OMD toured together again featuring the classic line-up of Andy McCluskey, Paul Humphreys, Malcolm Holmes and Martin Cooper. This line-up released a live-album in 2008: OMD Live: Architecture & Morality & More and has since followed up with 4 studio albums whilst also touring regularly. 2023 saw the release of their highest charting album to date, with Bauhaus Staircase debuting at No. 2 On the UK Charts.
