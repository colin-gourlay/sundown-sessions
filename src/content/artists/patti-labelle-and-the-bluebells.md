## About

Previously named [a3122859] for a short period of time. Consisted of Patti LaBelle and Cindy Birdsong, both formerly of the Ordettes, and Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash, both formerly of [a=The Del Capris]. Birdsong left the group to replace Florence Ballard in [a=The Supremes], and the other three members changed the group's name to [a=LaBelle], transforming themselves into futuristic disco-funk divas.
