## About

"Qdor (The Cult)" is an ancient and lost cult which was called back to life by four souls living between rocks and water of Fri√ªl (a region in north-east Italy).

"The one that is born from an amniotic chaos, is the hissing of a flower.
"Qdor" is a gesture of unconditional love.
It's the light that attends things in their lonely disintegration.
The red and the worm as a sign of Ancestral Vision: crawling Angels whisper words of salvation during the celebration of a rite.
Their words come as pollen on a mirrored world."
