Named after a P.I.L. (Public Image Limited) song (which can be found on the 1979 album _[r=358127]_), the band formed in 1999. The original band was Anthony Roman (bass, lead vocals), Tommy Williams (guitar, vocals) and Greg Collins (drums), and they soon wrote a three-song EP for the New Jersey label Gern Blandsten.

Their first album, The New Song And Dance, was produced by Tim O'Heir, came out on Gern Blandsten in 2000. Two years later, Radio 4 released their second album, this time produced by the duo known as [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/DFA,+The]DFA[/url]. This album was licensed by City Slang for distribution overseas.

From this album came the [r=208761] remix 12", which set the band in a more club-oriented direction, carrying the already dance-rock sound further into dance realms. Subsequent work has included more club-friendly remixes and further distribution world-wide.
