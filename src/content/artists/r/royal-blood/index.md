## About

Royal Blood are an English rock duo formed in Littlehampton in 2011. The current lineup consists of Jowel Bond (vocals, bass guitar, piano) and Ben Thatcher (drums). Their signature sound is built around Kerr's bass playing style, which sees him using various effects pedals and amps to make his bass guitar sound like an electric guitar and bass guitar at the same time. The duo were signed by Warner Chappell Music in 2013 and have since released four studio albums: Royal Blood (2014), How Did We Get So Dark? (2017),  Typhoons (2021), and Back to the Water Below (2023).
