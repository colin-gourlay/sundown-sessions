## About

The ringing guitars and British-styled alternative pop of Riverside echoed the Anglophiliac passions of another Pennsylvania combo, [a276605]. Not surprisingly, Riverside's debut album, [m=1123351], was produced by former Ocean Blue keyboardist [a474031]. When One was released on Sire Records in 1992, Riverside was virtually alone in their unyielding devotion to mid-'80s jangle.
