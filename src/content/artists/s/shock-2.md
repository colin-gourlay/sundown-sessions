## About

British musical act, and dance troupe formed in 1979. Due to their extravagant costumes (designed by Kahn and Bell) and performances, and their connection with the Blitz Club (London), they quickly found themselves at the forefront of the New Romantic movement of the early-1980s. Having secured a record deal with RCA they released a couple of singles, and supported several acts, including: [a3479], [a12588], [a70735], [a161785], [a23031], and [a74188].

Upon the departure of Pereno and Richards (who then went on to work with [a258639]), in 1981, they were reduced to a 4-piece. [a114675], who had simultaneously been a robotic performance art duo since 1980, left the group in 1982. It was with their departure that the act came to an end.
