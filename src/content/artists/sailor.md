This lineup released four albums in the period 1974 to 1977 that contained hit singles "A Glass of Champagne", "Girls, Girls, Girls" and "One Drink Too Many" all penned by Kajanus, before breaking up in 1978. Reformed by Pickett and Marsh in 1980 with [a=Gavin David] and [a=Virginia David] to release a single album before breaking up again. In 1989 the original lineup reformed and released two more albums before Kajanus left for good in 1995. Since then the band has continued with various changes in the lineup.
