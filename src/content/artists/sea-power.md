## About

Sea Power, previously known as British Sea Power and initially as British Air Power, are an English alternative rock band.
Their original lineup consisted of Scott Wilkinson, known as Yan (vocals, guitar), Neil Hamilton Wilkinson, known as Hamilton (bass guitar, vocals, guitar), Martin Noble, known as Noble (guitar) and Matthew Wood, known as Wood (drums).

Eamon Hamilton (keyboards, vocals, percussion, guitar) joined the band in autumn 2002. He left in 2006 and was subsequently replaced by Phil Sumner (cornet, keyboards), with Abi Fry (viola) also joining the band in 2008.

On Monday 9 August 2021, the band announced that they would henceforth be known as Sea Power due to "a rise in a certain kind of nationalism in this world – an isolationist, antagonistic nationalism that [they] don't want to run any risk of being confused with.", and that their new album, Everything Was Forever, would be released in February 2022.
