## About

Clam boys from Southern California, since 2017.

With Aaron Jones (now of Rinse & Repeat), they released the album Attack of the Giant Lobster Man. Having left, they re-recorded the song New Wave Party with singer Jack Kellems, and released it as a single. Months later, they recorded Planet Pink, their first physical release.

They are known in Orange County for their sea creature iconography, and retro stage presence.
