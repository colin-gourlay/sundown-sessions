## About

New Orleans garage prog heroes with alternative influences and songs that tell horror stories.  Per the online bio: Sometimes the Fall met separately in high school detention, renting an apartment, at a psychiatric hospital, and a Society of Engineers picnic. Together they make music that draws from multiple genres and diverse influences and defies easy classification. Counterpoint, complex arrangements, and story-telling are the hallmarks of their compositions, though their strong melodies and haunting lyrics make an impression on even the casual listener. Their name is taken from a short comic by Neil Gaiman and reflects the ability of the human spirit to overcome our fears and anxieties. They live in New Orleans. Their self-produced first recording, "The World Began" was released on the first day of Fall 2017.They currently expanding their live performances beyond New Orleans and recording a follow-up single, "Sailing to Pangea."
