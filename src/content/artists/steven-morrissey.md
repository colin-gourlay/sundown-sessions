## About

[b]Use this profile for any writing credits mentioning "S. Morrissey" or similar.[/b]

British vocalist, born May 22, 1959, in Manchester, United Kingdom. Former lead singer of [a=The Smiths]. Morrissey started his career as a lead singer for punk bands. He formed Sulky Young (renamed The Tee Shirts) and later joined [a=The Nosebleeds] (formed in the early 1970s under the name Wild Ram) with [a=Billy Duffy] ([a=The Cult]), replacing [a=Ed Banger] and [a=Vini Reilly]. However, in his autobiography Morrissey denied ever being a member of The Nosebleeds. He claims that Duffy recruited him after the break up of The Nosebleeds and they wrote songs together. For their live performances they hadn't decided on a band name. They roped in the rhythm section of The Nosebleeds and Paul Morley used this name for a live review.
