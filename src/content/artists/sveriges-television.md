## About

Sveriges Television (SVT) is the national television broadcaster in Sweden. It is now separate from, but was until 1979 part of, Sveriges Radio, which is the public radio broadcaster.

The Swedish public service media sector consists of three separate and independent companies, Sveriges Television (SVT), Sveriges Radio (SR) and Utbildningsradion (UR, the Educational Broadcasting Company).
All three companies are owned by a foundation and entirely funded by licence fees. Advertising is not permitted.
