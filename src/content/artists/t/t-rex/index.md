## About

Initially a British folk-rock combo called Tyrannosaurus Rex fronted by guitarist/vocalist Marc Bolan (born Mark Feld). They became glam rock pioneers and shortened their name to T. Rex in 1970. They had a series of top ten hits in the UK, including four number one singles. In America, the group only had one major hit - "Bang a Gong (Get It On)". They retained a following until Marc Bolan's death in 1977.
