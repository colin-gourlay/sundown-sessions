## About

British synth pop / art rock band founded in 1981 in London and disbanded in 1991. The group had a string of international hit singles including "[m=22872]", "[m=22902]", "[m=25562]", "[m=25278]", "[m=25824]" and "[m=26166]".

They moved away from synth-pop to a more experimental form with the album [i][m=26239][/i] in 1986, and their critical reputation increased. 
Their final two albums, [i][m=26436][/i] (1988) and [i][m=26553][/i] (1991), are highly acclaimed and remain influential to experimental alternative rock genres.

With Simon Brenner out, [a60622] was recruited to assist with the recording of their second album [i][m=25599][/i] (1984) and he soon became the band's producer and de facto fourth member. He played keyboards and became Hollis' frequent songwriting partner, co-writing all the songs on [i][m=26239][/i] (1986), [i][m=26436][/i] (1988) and [i][m=26553][/i] (1991). Although a major contributor to the band's studio output, [a60622] did not regularly play with the touring band, and was absent from the band's publicity material.
