## About

British synth pop / art rock band founded in 1981 in London and disbanded in 1991. The group had a string of international hit singles including "Talk Talk", "Today â€¢ It's So Serious", "It's My Life", "Such A Shame", "Life's What You Make It" and "Living In Another World".

They moved away from synth-pop to a more experimental form with the album _The Colour Of Spring_ in 1986, and their critical reputation increased. 
Their final two albums, _Spirit Of Eden_ (1988) and _Laughing Stock_ (1991), are highly acclaimed and remain influential to experimental alternative rock genres.

With Simon Brenner out, Tim Friese-Greene was recruited to assist with the recording of their second album _It's My Life_ (1984) and he soon became the band's producer and de facto fourth member. He played keyboards and became Hollis' frequent songwriting partner, co-writing all the songs on _The Colour Of Spring_ (1986), _Spirit Of Eden_ (1988) and _Laughing Stock_ (1991). Although a major contributor to the band's studio output, Tim Friese-Greene did not regularly play with the touring band, and was absent from the band's publicity material.
