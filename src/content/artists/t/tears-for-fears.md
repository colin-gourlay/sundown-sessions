## About

UK rock-pop group formed in 1981 by Curt Smith (b. 24 June 1961) and Roland Orzabal (b. 22 August 1961). After three platinum albums and a string of hit singles, the duo split in 1991. Orzabal continued under the band name, releasing the albums 'Elemental' (1993) and 'Raoul and the Kings of Spain' (1995), while Smith moved to the US and began a solo career. In 2000, the pair reestablished contact and started working together again on new material.
