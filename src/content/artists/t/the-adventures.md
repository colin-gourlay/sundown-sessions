They released two albums at Elektra and for their fourth and last album they were signed at Polydor that included their reworking of Mamas & The Papas, 1966 classic [url=http://www.discogs.com/Adventures-Monday-Monday/release/1754169]"Monday Monday"[/url]. Due to lack of success Polydor dropped them and soon after they disbanded. They regrouped briefly in 2007 and again in 2009 for some gigs in Belfast.
