## About

The Adventures were a Northern Irish rock/pop band, formed in Belfast in 1984 who had a number of hits during the 1980s and early 1990s.
The band moved to London where they signed to Chrysalis Records and released their first single in 1984. Following their debut album, the group moved to Elektra Records and scored their biggest hit, "Broken Land". Written by guitarist Pat Gribben, it reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and became the most played song on BBC Radio 1 in 1988.
The band were actively recording and touring from 1984 up until 1993, but despite being managed by the highly-influential Simon Fuller, The Adventures never achieved a significant commercial breakthrough.
The band have reformed several times to play live gigs and festivals in Belfast, including in 1997, twice in the 2000s, and in 2019. No further studio recordings have been made.
