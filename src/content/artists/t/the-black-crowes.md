## About

US blues rock band from Atlanta, Georgia. Formed in 1989, with a 3 year hiatus between 2002 and 2005. 

Disbanded in January 2015, over a dispute concerning Chris Robinson, who wanted drummer Gorman and brother Rich to surrender their share of the band.
They reformed in late 2019 after the brothers Robinson resolved their differences, with an all new band behind them, and are planning a tour throughout 2021.
