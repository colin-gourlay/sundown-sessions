## About

Los Angeles-based Power Pop rock quartet formed in 1978.  In 1979, the band had its first hit with "My Sharona," which was followed by "Good Girls Don't."  Although The Knack initially broke up in 1982, the band members remained on good terms and reunited (and broke up) several more times.  The original band members were Doug Fieger (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Berton Averre (lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), Prescott Niles (bass), and Bruce Gary (drums).
