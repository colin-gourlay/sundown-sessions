## About

British rock band from Birmingham formed in 1965 and disbanded in 1972. They formed into ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) after several line-up changes and primary songwriter Roy Woods's desire to form a new band that would play orchestral as well as hard rock. The Move are perhaps best known for their string of top 5 UK chart hits, including their debut "Night of Fear" (#2), "I Can Hear the Grass Grow (#5), Flowers in the Rain (#2), Fire Brigade (#3), and Blackberry Way (#1) all between 1966 and 1968. Despite releasing 4 albums, only their 1968 debut "Move" charted, reaching #15 in the UK.
