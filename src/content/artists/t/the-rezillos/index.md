## About

Scottish band active between 1976-1979 (though they split in December 1978), and sporadically since 2001 to the present. See also [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/661241-Revillos-The]The Revillos[/url], a follow-up band, established in 1979 by Eugene Reynolds and Fay Fife.
The Rezillos was formed in Edinburgh, in March 1976 by Alan Forbes (later Eugene Reynolds) with him taking responsibility for drums and vocals, Dave Smythe (later Dr. D.K. Smythe) playing the bass, Jo Callis (later Luke Warm) on lead guitar and vocals, and Mark Harris (later 'Hi-Fi' Harris) on rhythm guitar and vocals. They rehearsed for months before adopting their image and aliases as well as several other members, so that by August 1976 they were an eight-piece with the line-up now including Fay Fife (Sheilagh Hynde) and Gail Warning (Gail Jamieson) on backing vocals, Angel Paterson (Alistair Patterson) on drums, and William Mysterious (Alastair Donaldson) on saxophone. After several more months of rehearsals, they eventually performed their first gig on Friday, 5th November 1976 at Teviot Row Student Union, in Edinburgh.
Reformed in the early 2000's The Rezillos have had several releases since and now tour regularly with the current line up of originals, Eugene Reynolds, Fay Fife and Angel Paterson with Chris Agnew on bass and Jim Brady on guitar.
