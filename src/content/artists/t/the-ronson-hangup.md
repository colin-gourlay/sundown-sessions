## About

The Ronson Hangup were formed when brothers Steve and Mal Pinkerton from The Anyones teamed up with Ash Naylor (Even), Luke Thomas (The Pictures) and Dave Mudie (Cannon) out of a shared admiration for Mick Ronson, the legendary guitarist from David Bowieâ€™s band The Spiders From Mars. In recent years, Erica Menting has joined the group while co-founder Mal Pinkerton has left.
