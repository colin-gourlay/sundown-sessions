## About

Rock band formed in Leeds, UK, in 1980, by singer Andrew Eldritch and guitarist Gary Marx. They were soon joined by drummer [a463064] – the stage name for what became a long succession of drum machines. The band’s dark subject matter, literary references (Eldritch’s lyrics nod to anyone from Shelley to [a227848]), cavernous reverb and black record sleeves led the music press to dub them a “goth rock” act, though the band has always rejected this description.

The debut album *[m=2795]* was not released until 1985, and the lineup that recorded it split soon afterwards. To prevent departing members [a257204] and [a164067] from renaming themselves [a115235], Eldritch hurriedly released his own album under this name; Adams and Hussey instead formed [a99925]. Eldritch then rebooted the Sisters as a duo of himself and bassist [a155571]; the 1987 album *[m=2836]* prominently featured synthesizers. In 1990 the Sisters returned to live performance after a five-year absence, promoting a new album, *[m=61848]*, recorded mainly by Eldritch and guitarist [a238296].

Two further singles followed, before a long feud with record company [l999] began. Although the band, with various lineups, has continued to tour regularly – playing a mix of old and new songs – ever since, there has been no new Sisters release since 1993.
