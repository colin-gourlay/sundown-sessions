## About

Taking the Fall formed in early 2005 and have since performed extensively in the Dunedin music scene. A combination of melodic hooks, intense guitars, a dynamic rhythm section and Tom Dysartâ€™s compelling vocal describes their sound. Their stage show incorporates both an aural and visual attack on the audience.
