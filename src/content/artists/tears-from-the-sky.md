## About

Tears from the Sky was a metalcore band, originally from Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec, Canada (later re-located to Montreal, Quebec, Canada) founded in June of 1999. The band went through a great deal of line-up changes during it's ten-year existence. When the band broke up in February of 2009, none of the original band members were still in the line-up. The final two band members to join the band were Alexandre Deschênes (on bass) and Daniel Rochefort (on guitar); they did not record on any released material.
