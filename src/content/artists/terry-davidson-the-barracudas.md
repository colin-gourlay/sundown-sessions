## About

Columbus, Ohio 1966-7
If you've heard the lone recording by Terry Davidson and the Barracudas, a rousing recording of the Tommy Roe hit "Hurray For Hazel" on the Hilltop 1966 LP, you know that Terry Davidson, the lead singer, is a young kid. As a matter of fact, the whole band were young kids, roughly 9-13 years old at the time. Their age did not prevent them from competing with the older bands in town, as they had a good stage show including a couple like-aged go-go girls.
