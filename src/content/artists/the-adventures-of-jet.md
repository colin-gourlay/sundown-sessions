## About

Alter ego of power pop group Bobgoblin, in which they abandoned that band's dystopian freedom fighters concept and made albums with other conceptual inspirations.

Dallas, Texas-based Bobgoblin released their second album, [i]The Twelve-Point Master Plan[/i] (1997), on major label MCA Records, but subsequent disagreements with the label led to the termination of their contract. As Bobgoblin, the band revolved around a fictitious thematic concept in which they were freedom fighters in a future war against a fascistic, corporate-run state. After separating from MCA, the members (singer/keyboardist Hop Litzwire, drummer Rob Avsharian, bassist Tony Jannotta, and guitarist Jason Weisenberg) abandoned this concept and started a new project under the name The Adventures Of Jet (AOJ).

AOJ signed to My Records and released 1999's [i]Part 3: Coping With Insignificance[/i], a record inspired by their negative experiences with MCA. Weisenberg subsequently left, and Jannotta resumed his original dual role as both guitarist and bassist. AOJ's second album, [i]Muscle[/i], released in 2003 on Suburban Home Records, combined themes of aging with musical inspiration from 1960s car songs. AOJ subsequently became dormant as the members pursued other, separate projects. They reconvened as Bobgoblin in the late 2000s and have released new music under that name.
