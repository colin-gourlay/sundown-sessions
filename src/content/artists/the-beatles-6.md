## About

This group and their recording(s) were created by Philadelphia DJ Jerry Blavat, aka "The Geator with the Heater" and "The Big Boss with the Hot Sauce". The singers called themselves the Lytations, a mixture of guys from the Ly-Dells and Quotations. The composers were “J. Lemmon” (clearly a spoof on John Lennon) and J. Strong (Jack Strong, lead singer). The other guys were baritone Kenny Harper, first tenor Frank Torpey, second tenor Bob Bintliff, and bass Billy Giangilio. They also recorded as the Five Shits.
