## About

The Black Heart Death Cult are a drone-rock psych-rock band from Melbourne, Australia.
'Droney psych mantras, sonic opiates & space glazed kaleido fuzz jams for the all too new dark age.'
In their own words from their Bandcamp webpage: "Sparkly magic mountain-drops fall from the outer cosmic reaches in the re-imagined mind-forrest of The Flower Captain. Gloom/doom singer/songwriter Sasha L Smith envisions a brave new dark age of droney bliss in the sonic bazaar. Fret wizard Bill Patching, sub-sonic vibe dealer Deon Slaviero & human time-machine Andy Nunns are well on the magic bus, which we call “The Black Heart Death Cult”.
The band are comprised of:
[a=Sasha L. Smith] on guitar and vocals
[a=Deon Slaviero] on bass
[a=Andrew Nunns] on drums
Bill Patching on guitar
