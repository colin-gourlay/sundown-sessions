## About

"The Cars" were formed in 1966. Founding members: Reinhard Beyer – drums; Rudi Brockmeyer – bass; Jürgen Schmeißer –guitar. At that time they played the typical beat of the time at weekends on youth balls, in gyms and halls of inns. The group released several singles, including a collaboration with the Scottish singer Kenny MacCaskill (The Fleets). Due to a record deal with Polydor in 1972, the band changed their name to "Revolver" at the request of the record company and released the 7" Single "But How I Love It / Down, Down"
