## About

Male vocal soul group from the US. They achieved no significant success in their native country but were huge in the UK thanks to the Northern Soul scene. Most notable for their classic 1973 single 'It Really Hurts Me Girl'. This tune has been credited with starting the Modern Soul scene. It was first played at the legendary Blackpool Mecca club by DJ [a=Ian Levine]. With the tracks  contemporary arrangement and pre-disco rhythm it split the soul scene in two, the 60s purists with 'Motown' soundalikes and those into the 'Modern' sound. They produced a handful of 45s, originals of which are collectible (and expensive!)
