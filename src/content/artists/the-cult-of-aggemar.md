## About

Metal band from Noord-Brabant, The Netherlands. Active since April 2012.

5 individuals who all had a vague vision with a date, a time and a place, a secret temple located somewhere in Dongen, this is where they met each other and found an ancient encrypted book. The book of "AGGEMAR".

After translating the first pages the book appeared to contain rituals, spells, sheet music, prayers, stories and more about the ancient king Aggemar, his kingdom and his moon tribe.
Aggemar forced the 5 individuals, from his kingdom, to found "The Cult of Aggemar", start a band and explore their new found religion.
The members have to tell the story of the death of Aggemar, his thoughts and the wars that led to the downfall of his kingdom, his moon tribe and the end of the world.
These events all took place well before the rise of dinosaurs and humans.

Still, not everything is clear, because the translation is still in full swing to this day.

The music of the cult are translations and narrations from the book of "Aggemar".
Comparisons are made with Limp Bizkit, Iron Maiden, Korn and Body Count and they have common ground with groovy nu-rap metal, but they are also completely unique and authentic in their sound.
According to stories from the audience, the performances are energetic, contain humour, obviously have a lot of fun on the stage and the singer could have been a rapper as well.

Earlier celebrations took place with First Fight Down, Bestial Devastation, Buzz Rockington (and others) and were on Rocktober Fest, Sound of Wollukstock en Slim in de Lift.
