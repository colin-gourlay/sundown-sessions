## About

The Damned Few is dirty, nasty, loud and proud. It’s the sound of rock, blues, psyche and grunge, but on steroids.

Pure rock ‘n roll music, crafted with heart, soul and bare hands. It’s just a supersonic smack in the face and a big ‘f*ck you’ to the modern popmusic we love to hate. Rock and f*cking roll!
