## About

The Doors of the 21st Century were an American rock band formed in 2002 by two former members of [a=The Doors], [a=Ray Manzarek] and [a=Robby Krieger].  Also known as "D21C" and "Riders on the Storm", they finally settled on using "Manzarekâ€“Krieger" or "Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger of The Doors" for legal reasons after court battles between the two musicians and Doors original drummer [a=John Densmore]. They performed The Doors material exclusively until the death of Manzarek in 2013, when the group disbanded.
