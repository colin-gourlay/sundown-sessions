## About

Nigerian band active thirteen years spanning 1974 to 1987 from the South Eastern State of Nigeria which was later renamed Cross River State before it was split into Cross River and Akwa Ibom States.

There is a certain [b]Patrick Udoh[/b] famously acclaimed as the leader and main songwriter of the band, but the band credits are often limited in this regard, but a few occasions, Patrick Udoh actually runs the show either with a different lineup or as a label executive. Most members moved on to pastoral work and other music-related endeavours.
