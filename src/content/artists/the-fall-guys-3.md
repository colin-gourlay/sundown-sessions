## About

American touring band formed in the 1960s by Don Rieck and Jack Williams, with Joey Dio, Kenny Kuchar and Bill Laws.
Later in the 1980s, they regrouped as The Fall Guys & a Gal, continuing with Williams and Rieck, and Tony Belch, Jimmy Carson, Gary Vogel, Jimmy "Jazz" Mazzo and Stephanie Bates Carson.
The band performed regularly alongside some of the biggest names in the music business, including Sammy Davis Jr., Roy Orbison, Marie Osmond, Tanya Tucker and Barbara Mandrell, and comedians Rich Little, Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers. They sometimes backed prominent singers such as Jim Stafford. They also performed at many corporate events.
