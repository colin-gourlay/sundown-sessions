## About

The Fall, The Rise are 4 friends from Birmingham. They also played rock music. Together they peddled their tuneful, hard- edged wares for over 5 years (2007-2012).
The bands goal was a simple one: Write music they enjoy playing. This invariably lead to songs dealing in quiet/loud dynamics, powerhouse drumming,fluid basslines,intricate guitar work and lyrics dealing with the human condition
