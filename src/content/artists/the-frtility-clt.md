## About

Milking the Cosmic Cow since late 2008.

A band of astral travellers and planewalkers fulfilling pledges to preternatural cosmic cow deities and hypersensual fertility priestesses channeling aural psychotropic revelations from time immemorial through subterranean cults of clandestine rites of fervent nefarious fluid exchanges taking place in ancient isthmic necropolises inhabited by keepers of arcane legacies of feline-headed copulatress hierophants practicing idolatry of lascivious demiurge vixens while listening to Black Sabbath.
