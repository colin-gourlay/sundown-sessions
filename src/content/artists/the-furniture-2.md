## About

US 60s garage rock band from Galesburg, IL.
They were part of the Peoria "scene" that revolved around IT Studios. The group previously was named Uncle Billy and The Vagrants, but they changed their name into Furniture by the will of Sam Cerami, the owner of Stature Records. Their sound was very much like The Kinks.
