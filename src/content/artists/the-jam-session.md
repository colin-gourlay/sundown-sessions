## About

Since the very beginning back in 1998 The Jam Session has been on a never ending quest for doing their own thing, which has lead them on strange paths in heavy and experimental music. 
Going thru the whole catalog of releases you'll find everything from insane hardcore, progressive punk and doomy dark metal. It was never their goal to make it as strange as possible, itÂ´s just their way to deal with the small town boredom and the result of 5 different individuals trying to express themselves as one unit. 
The Band has been on ice since 2007.
