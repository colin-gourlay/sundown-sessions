## About

The original, ‘60’s Sunset Strip era Knack was formed in 1965 at Hollywood High by [a=Michael Chain].  The band was originally named The InMates but after a Shindig road show changed their moniker to The Knack.
  
The original InMates line-up consisted of:
[a=Michael Chain] - Lead Vocals, 
[a=Dink Kaplan] - Guitar, 
Ken Meyers - Drums, and 
[a=Larry Gould] - Bass.  
[a=Bobby Cochran (2)] later replaced Kaplan and [a=Pug Baker] replaced Meyers.

The band broke up in 1969, following the release of 4 singles, and an EP (France only).
