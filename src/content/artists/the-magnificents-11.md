## About

In March 1958, there was another "Magnificents" session at Vee-Jay. The four songs recorded were "Don't Leave Me," "Let's Do The Cha Cha," "Rosebud," and "Ozeta." However, the group who did these recordings wasn't Johnny Keyes' aggregation ([a=The Magnificents (3)]). Instead, it was a group called the 5 Wonders from Evansville, Indiana, comprised of Wilton Boyd, Paul Boyd, Ed Hathaway, Jack Nance, and Leslie Reed. Strangely, neither Calvin Carter nor Montague himself could remember anything about them, but after the session, Vee-Jay decided to re-name them the "Magnificents". Their recording of "Don't Leave Me" did well in the Chicago area, and this time, Vee-Jay "remembered" to send it out for review. On May 19, it was rated "good," along with Little Richard's "Ooh! My Soul," the Drifters' "Drip Drop," the Hi-Fives' "Dorothy," the Fi-Tones' "You'll Be The Last," and the Impressions' "For Your Precious Love." They stayed together for several years before disbanding. However, with the substitution of John E. Williams for Paul Boyd and Leslie Reed, they got back together in 1980 and recorded "You Turn Me On"/"On My Way Up" for Detroit's D.T. Records in 1982.
