## About

This Tucson trio, The Mission Creeps paints dark but catchy cinematic panoramas, like Ian Curtis lost in the desert instead of a crumbling Manchester.
The Mission Creeps are renowned for their chemistry and dynamic live stage performances. Each show differs and may include a light show; belly, go go, or fire dancers; video; dual drummers; percussion; theremin; accordion; and haunting samples.
