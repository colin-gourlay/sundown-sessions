## About

South African band - According to Max Mojapelo, the group included Sankie Chounyane, Oupa Hlongwane, Norman Hlongwane and Sam Thabo, though the lineup would shift throughout the seventies. Others that performed with the group included Dinah Mbata, Blondie Makhene, Philip Malela, Jabu Khanyile, Vusi Shange, Rammy McKenzie, Jabu Sibumbe and Lloyd Lelosa.

Finding a chronology and discography of The Movers is proving to be quite difficult. The earliest single in the flat international archive, Danny's Corner (City Special, CYB 67) dates from 1969 and is also featured on this LP, which was issued on Teal's budget series "Music for Leisure" in 1970. Teal Holdings introduced budget LP´s to South Africa in 1970 through their newly formed subsidiary—Music for Leisure, Ltd.
