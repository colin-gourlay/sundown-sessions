## About

Japanese punk band formed in 1998 by Toshihiko Arima, Kazushi (The Trash, ex-The Clay & Chudoku), and Hiko (Gauze). Initially called 葉隠, changed to The Radio Active Stars in 1999. Broke up in 2003, got back together with a new lineup in 2008. The band has gone through numerous lineup changes throughout its history. In their early days they played a lot of hardcore punk shows at Antiknock etc and their original band sound was speedy punk/hardcore, while it leans toward more melodic punk rock after 2008. 

No longer active.
