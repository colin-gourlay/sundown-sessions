## About

One-off collaboration for two 1980 live concerts by [a=The Stranglers]. In the spring of 1980, [a=Hugh Cornwell] was in Pentonville Prison for drug possession. With two gigs scheduled at the London Rainbow for 3 & 4 April, the management decided to turn things around by approaching a number of well-known artists to fill in for the absent Cornwell on vocals.
