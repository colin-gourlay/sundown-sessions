## About

Born in the beginning of the millenium, Two Finger has evolved from an electro-clash performance band into a collaborative, ambiant-oriented project. Each track is based on the interaction between two synhcronized computers. Pads and glitches are counterbalanced by simple rythms to create somewhat accessible songs.
