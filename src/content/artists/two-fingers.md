## About

Two Finger is an electronic project. It was formed in 2007 as a duo of Amon Tobin and Joe Chapman. In 2010 Joe Chapman left and Two Fingers became a solo project of Amon Tobin.

Two Fingers began with Amon Tobin and Joe “Doubleclick” Chapman. The pair met when Tobin lived in Brighton and bonded over an interest in music that ran way beyond the boundaries of “electronica”. While Tobin was living in Montreal, they began bouncing beats back and forth, trying to apply production techniques associated with UK styles like drum & bass to the template of hip hop. When they had a few tunes together they sent them to Sway. He was so taken with what they were doing, he flew straight out to Montreal and recorded seven tracks with them. The remaining rhythms were voiced by sometime Missy protégé Ms Jade and dancehall legend Cecile.

2012 saw the release of "Stunt Rhythms", which is the first Two Fingers release to be produced solely by Amon Tobin, since the departure of Joe Chapman in 2010.
