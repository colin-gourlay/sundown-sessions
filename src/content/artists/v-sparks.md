## About

With the blood and glitter of 70's Glam Rock, V Sparks have burst through with a sound and attitude sure to steal your attention. The Chicago based band consists of Alan Lewis(Lead Vocalist and Keys), guitar virtuoso Prescott Kagan(Guitar and Vocals), Sam Libretti(Bass) and Adam Long(Drums), Zach Duran(Guitar) and Paul Wierdak on Keys. Drawing from past luminaries as David Bowie, T.Rex, The Beatles and ELO to modern acts as The Arcade Fire, The Strokes and Vampire Weekend they have brought to pass a contemporary glitzy mess of rock that you cant help identify with and feel good about. Having shared the stage with New York Dolls and OK Go, V Sparks consistently entertains and engage their audiences with eclectic pizazz and unfailing precision. Equally as solid is the 2017 "New Sensation" EP. With standout tracks “Death of A Star” ,"Hey Love” and "Sebastian", V Sparks proves that they can deliver the goods in the studio as well. Beautifully melding glitzy glam, good old fashioned Rock ‘N Roll with orchestration and pop sensibilities uncommon in today's music. These guys just may be the modern day answer to the genius of great music past.
