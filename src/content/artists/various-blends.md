## About

Alternative rappers Various Blends were originally formed in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1991, and consisted of MCs/producers Friz-B and Eb.F (both friends from childhood) and MC Rasco. They are both also original members of the private hip hop organization Urban Umpires. 

They grew out of a previous group called Children of One Destiny, which also included future solo artist Saafir. In 1995, the trio released a local 12” single, “Chill as I Flex,” but went on hiatus when Rasco departed for a solo career the following year (he would go on to record for Peanut Butter Wolf’s Stones Throw label). In the meantime, Eb.F DJed around the area under the name DJ Rasta Cue Tip, and he and Friz-B reconvened as Various Blends in 1999. With production by both group members, as well as Peanut Butter Wolf, and turntable contributions from DJ Serg, Various Blends finally issued their first full-length album, Levitude, on Baraka in late 1999. It gained favorable reviews for its inventive, trippy production, but not much exposure. Baraka also issued an instrumental version of the album in 2000.
