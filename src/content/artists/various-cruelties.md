## About

VARIOUS CRUELTIES is a mod/goth/pop incarnation. Formed by Liam O'Donnell in London, England, in 2010.
"If It Wasn't For You" was the first thing O'Donnell recorded as Various Cruelties.
Various Cruelties is largely the project of Liam O’Donnell, a distant relative of Oscar Wilde. Born in London to a Scottish father and an Irish mother, O’Donnell moved to Leeds in Northern England as a teenager, and began performing as a singer/songwriter. He chose the stage name Various Cruelties after seeing a painting of the same name by American artist Ed Ruscha.
