## About

WIN-Initiative has been forced to discontinue its operations. Due to the impact of Covid-19 and a downward trend in stock photography, it has become unsustainable for our boutique agency to survive.

All digital content has been removed and royalties due will be distributed. No action is needed on our Talentâ€™s part. WIN-Initiative would like to thank everyone for their creativity and support for the past fourteen years.

WIN-Initiative [was] an independent stock photography company that [licensed] images based on global youth culture. Founded in 2007 by photographer Hans Neleman, WIN, which stands for Worldwide Image Navigation, licenses images from its community of photographers from around the world. Essentially functioning as a collective, WIN Scouts are located in 22 countries. These Scouts assist in finding and retaining new talent, as well as being the liaison with the WIN headquarters team in SoHo, New York City.
