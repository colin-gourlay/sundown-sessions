## About

WIN Marcinak is a songwriter, vocalist and dancer emanating from the edgy San Francisco arts scene. His vocal styling encapsulates the robustness of a warm and sturdy Broadway technique crashed with a Euro-pop approach that resonates far beyond the mundane boy band gimmicky sound of today. WIN has been performing throughout the country for the last two decades. He launched Burning Tyger Music and releases his own productions. In 2004, Win released his full-length CD titled ‘In My Heart,’ which spawned several dance hits including the title track, ‘It’s A Dream’ and the unforgettable cover of Kajagoogoo’s ‘Too Shy.’ The songs were licensed by DMX Music and immediately turned into staples at a variety of venues and clubs around the world. WIN is also currently featured on Ultra’s ‘Mad About the Boy’ compilation. This summer, WIN unveils his new single ‘Kiss & Tell’ – a reinvention of the pop rock classic Bryan Ferry tune. Making a special featured appearance on the package will be the voice of Exposé diva Gioia Bruno. The hot track will be hitting radio and clubs in the US and the UK with a sundry of dynamic mixes by Warren Rigg, Mark Picchiotti, Josh Harris, Dena Cucci, The Perry Twins and Jake Benson. Everyone’s in it to WIN it! With WIN’s vibrant recording and performing career burgeoning, he shows no signs of slowing down. WIN just keeps on winning!
