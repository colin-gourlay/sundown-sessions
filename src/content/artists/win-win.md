## About

Accomplished producer and in-demand remixer Alex “XXXchange” Epton has come together with lifelong friend Chris Devlin (of Devlin & Darko and video-collage artist/producer Ghostdad to form WIN WIN. The self-titled project on Vice Music serves as a unique model for the future of electronic music performance, having sprouted from the desire to supplement the auditory stimuli with a visual element that shifts with the mood of the music. WIN WIN’s musical efforts are manifested visually by Brooklyn-based video collagist, Ghostdad, who dredges pop-media archives and re-assembles clips live, juxtaposing moving images for optimum effect.

XXXchange first made national headlines as a founding member of electro-rap trendsetting group Spankrock in 2005. With so many sound-alikes popping up in the wake of their debut album Yoyoyoyoyo, Alex refined his approach and developed a reputation for his minimal, disco-tinged instrumental work. Few have had the opportunity to remix such a diverse, credible array of musicians as XXXchange, whose resume includes official interpretations for Thom Yorke, The Death Set, Bjork and many, many more. Alex has since achieved a full-on songwriting credit for The Kills while penning half of Kele’s eponymous debut earlier this year. Devlin won success as a member of popular DJ duo Devlin & Darko while also contributing heavily to the Spankrock album as well.

WIN WIN, the self-titled debut album slated for a February 15th release on Vice Music, is an elastic demonstration of hyperactive yet tactful electro, anchored by the single “RELEASERPM” featuring Lizzie Bougatsos of Gang Gang Dance contributing wafer-thin vocals to the layers of synthetic instrumentation. Other guests include Alexis of Hot Chip and former partner-in-crime Naeem of Spankrock.
