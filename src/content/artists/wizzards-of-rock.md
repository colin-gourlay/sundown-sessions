## About

Sheeck has been in the Hip Hop game since the 80's. He was an original member of the infamous group “Above The Law”, doing production on several tracks and having a highly influential impact on the group. Due to contractual disagreements, Sheeck and Above The Law parted ways as a group. As Above The Law continued on, Sheeck stayed busy behind the scenes producing and writing for himself, Above The Law and other groups alike.

Through a long journey in the music industry, often taking a back seat on his own career, Sheeck has since emerged with his solo album “UnderGround Hog” , released in 2007, with the first single “Crazy” featuring Suga Free. After hooking back up with fellow Pomona producer, Tony “TouchTone” Isaac, the two collaborated on a few tracks and Sheeck followed through with his own production on the rest of the album. Not only showing the mastery of his music production skills, Sheeck displays an ability like no other on his lyrical style and content. Once you hear his music, you can clearly see that this artist is a seasoned vet and not a newcomer to Hip Hop.

Sheeck is now part of a NEW group entitled Dreaded. The Album will release early 2011, while the first sneak peek song is on Youtube entitled "Krooked Letter'r" performed by Rickshaw with Sheeck doing the spoken word. The new project is "conscience" music, meant to stimulate the mind and teach knowledge unlike the brainless mind music out today.
