## About

Formed in Swindon UK from the ashes of the band **The Helium Kidz** and were active from 1975 to 2006.
They were a musically adventurous group who first made an impact as a post-punk new wave band but refused to be pigeonholed by recording dub, folk-rock, psychedelia and pure pop as the mood took them.
The classic line-up was Andy Partridge (guitar & vocals), Colin Moulding (bass & vocals), Dave Gregory (guitar & keyboards, left in 1999) and Terry Chambers (drums, left in 1982).
Barry Andrews was the original keyboard player but he left in 1979 to be replaced by Dave Gregory. The band ceased performing live in 1982, prompting Terry to leave and, rather than replacing him, they then used various session drummers for their remaining studio albums.
Their live legacy continues through Terry's band [a12676994].
