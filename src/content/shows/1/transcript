Well, good evening and welcome. My name is Colin Goorley and this is the sundown session,
it's live on K107. So this is a new weekly show running every Wednesday immediately after
Letty Rocks, like I say every Wednesday from 8 to 10 and it's probably worth giving a bit
introduction. So by way of a backstory, I've been lurking in the shadows of K107 towers for
roughly 10 years anyway and really it came to my attention when I started listening to
religiously on a Monday evening at school dancing and we'll run that later. Fast forward,
you know, eight or nine years I was asked if I'd be interested in having a show my own and
I was just like, you know, where do I sign? Absolutely love to and then I had this idea
about running a show in the evening. The sundown sessions, the irony is not lost to me, I'm looking
out the window just now and the sun hasn't set yet but here we go. Anyway, I'm still very much
finding my feet here so I thought it'd be quite apt to open the show with a song by Queens of the
Stone Age. This is called Feet Don't Fill Me.
Feet don't fill me now
When the needle hit the groove
I commenced moving
I was chasing what's calling me
Feet don't fill me now
One foot in the cup, one in the clouds
Feet don't fill me now
I just gotta move on
Life is hard, that's why no one survives
I'm much older than I thought I'd be
Feel like a fool, yeah like a dancing fool
Footloose and fancy free bones
Feet don't fill me now
Stand in the gutter with my head to the clouds
Feet don't fill me now
I just gotta move on
Feet don't fill me now
Feet don't fill me now
I lost myself, the breaking point
It's all I know to do except for hide
The trace, break lights, and dust
You're driving my feelings, I cannot hide
To be so civilized
One must tell civilized
I just gotta move on
Me and my gang come to bust you loose
We move with an urgency
Between pleasure and agony, I roll the line
That's the sour words calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
Time to go, regret it later
Wake up and take it as it comes
Feel yourself take space, bare my finger
We take the long way home
Feet don't fill me now
Do what you gotta do, oh do it now
Feet don't fill me now
I just gotta move on
I'd actually argue that most music sounds better with headphones on anyway
but that track is certainly no exception
I recall the first time I heard it back in 2017 I think
2017 it was the opening track from the album Villains
and I was absolutely blown away by it
and the first thing I did actually was just pick up the guitar
and then I put it down just as quick as I picked it up
It was a lot of guitars going on, it's this kind of chuggy chuggy sound
which rather nicely leads on to this
next track. Let me know, do you think it sounds
similar or is it different? You can text me on

You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a short away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken
Shattered and lied, I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a short and we can die
