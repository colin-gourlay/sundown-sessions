George Young is the older brother of Malcolm and Angus Young, who would go on to form AC/DC in the early 1970s. George Young, along with his Easybeats bandmate Harry Vanda, played a crucial role in AC/DC's early success. The duo became prominent record producers and worked on AC/DC's first five albums, including High Voltage and T.N.T., helping to shape the band's raw, hard-edged sound that would define their career. |
