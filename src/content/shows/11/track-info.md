In 1884, Lee was convicted of the murder of his employer, Emma Keyse, The evidence against Lee was largely circumstantial, and he always pleaded his innocence. February 23, 1885, Lee's execution turned into a bizarre series of events that would make him famous. Three times, the trapdoor of the gallows failed to open when the lever was pulled, despite the mechanism having been tested and found to be in working order. The executioner and prison officials were baffled, and after the third attempt, the execution was halted.speculation that divine intervention had saved Lee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
