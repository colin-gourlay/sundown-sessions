The reunion we wanted the reunion we got. MccArtney famously said you cant reheat a soufle - I'm inclined to agree with him and if there was ever a case in point it was when REM reformed recently.

Love that track. Some more work in the pipeline... First time I ever heard of a crowdfunding campaign was Lloyd Cole (which raised an eyebrow at the time). with a little bit of help from you we can get into the studio and start laying these tracks down. So if you want to forgoe a coffee... there's a lot of 'packages' available from a nominal donation to get your hands on the the full album digital download before it's official release! Right up to and I kid you not - a personal gig just for you in your home or garden! She's 68% of the funding goal, so... be quick though - only 5 days left. |

The white label 12" EP I have as the singles, Too Young and We Should Be.  They've been confirmed to play Doune The Rabbit Hole festival in 2025 along with The Skids, Rezillos, Goodbye Mr Mack, Countess of Fife (ALL of these artists have featured on SundownSessions at one point in the recent past). Of course they are playing PJ Malloys Dec 7 2024 - I've got my tickets.                                                                                                                                                                               |

Given that this was released 6 Sep, it was an ADVANCE COPY 5th October and it's called NEXT DAY SHIPPING  - the irony of all that is not lost on me.... Tonight they are playing The Moth Club down in London as part of a bigger tour, they are playing SNEAKY PETEs in Edinburgh on Friday                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
