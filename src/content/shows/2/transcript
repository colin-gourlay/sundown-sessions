Well, good evening and welcome. My name's Collin Gurley and you're listening to the Fundown Sessions
live on K107. And I just want to thank Collette there for making that handover quite seamless and
I'm delighted to say that while she helped me put that record on, she's still going to speak to me. So
I happen to like it, but that's the beauty about music. It's all subjective, isn't it?
Anyway, if we still get any stragglers listening from the Letter Rocks show, that song will
almost certainly be familiar to you.
I was going to say originally by Deep Purple, but it wasn't originally, it's actually been
covered quite a few times.
It was Cooley Shaker's Biggest Sit, that's what you just listened to, written by Joe
South for the Billy Joe Royal and subsequently covered by somebody's image in 67 and of course
Deep Purple in 1968 and yeah, Cooley Shaker.
I quite like that version.
Anyway, kicking off the show, I thought that it might be quite interesting to, especially
after the discussion with Collette, I'm not going to make a bold claim and say that I'm
going to play cover versions that are better than the originals.
Let's just say they're interesting.
And I certainly think this holds true to this Decks record, that's certainly what Frankie
says anyway.
When you let me in I want to be your friend I want to guide your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs around, spell the hymns and
Shake your hands, got my engines Together we could break this trap
We run till we drop and baby we'll never go back
Oh, you'll walk with me out of the wild
Cause baby I'm a scared and lonely rider
I've got to know how it feels
I want to know love's wild
I want to know that love is real
Oh, you'll walk with me out of the wild
Cause baby I'm a scared and lonely rider
I've got to know how it feels
I want to know love's wild
I want to know that love is real
Cause baby I'm a scared and lonely rider
I've got to know how it feels
On the palace, semi-powered drones
Scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair and review mirrors
And the boys try to look so hot
The amusement park rises bold and soft
Kids are huddled on a beach in the mist
I want to die with you when you're on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss
Ah, ah, ah
Highways share with broken heroes
On a last stand powered drive
Everybody sign on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Today I'm a scared and lonely rider
I've got to know love's wild
I want to know love's wild
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday, girl, I don't know where
We'll get to the place that we really wanna go
And we'll walk in the sun, but till then
Baby, we were born to run
Baby, we were born to run
Champs like us, baby, we were born to run
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Champs like us, baby, we were born to run
It was a very, very short gig, of course, Relax featured
And it was really when Frankie were quite the phenomenon
And, yeah, I happen to think that's better than the original
I'm gonna go out on the limb and say that
That was originally a Bruce Springsteen song
Featured on, in fact, it was the name of his third album, Born to Run, 1975
Let me know what you think. You can text me on 0772-358-1687
Now Ziggy played guitar
Charming good with grit and gilly
And the spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
And Ziggy will listen
Screw the pies and screw down the hairdo
Like a cat from Japan
He could lick on by smiling
He could even turn
Came on some loaded man
A well hung and snow-white tan
Now where were the spiders?
While the flies tried to break up our halls
Just a mere light to guide us
So we fixed about his band
And should we cross his sweet hand
Ziggy played for time
Driving us that we were build to
The kids were just crass
Oh, he was the mess
With god-giver ass
He'd talk it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy is sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Now Ziggy plays guitar
Now Ziggy plays guitar
Ziggy starred us, of course
And that version was by Bauhaus
I was a bit too young at the time when that came out
It was back in 1982
And I didn't really appreciate them, like I say
Because they were a bit too young
But they released their final studio album
Right, I think it was about 2006, 2008
It was the noughties anyway, that's for sure
And that certainly reignited my interest in Bauhaus
And then I started digging back in the back catalogue
And started to understand that there's a bit more to them
Than just kicking the eye
Now, this next track
I did give out the studio text number
And I need to put a disclaimer in first
Before I start this
Before I'm accused of sort of making a
Quite a radical comment
When I did say that
I think these covers are better in some cases
I'd say they're interesting
This one that I'm going to play is by Far Corporation
I think it's interesting for me on a very personal level
Because it's
When I first really discovered Led Zeppelin
Indirectly through this record
And there was a lot of
There was a lot of interest when
Stairway to Heaven, the single
Was released at the time, not least because it was
It was quite new at the time, it was 1985
And it was, I guess, the first kind of supergroup
I mean, if you look on the back of the single
It reads like a movie credit list
The amount of musicians that were involved in this
The ones that stick in my mind were
There was quite a few members from Toto amongst others
The interesting thing about this is
It's called Far Corporation
And this supergroup was assembled by Frank Farian
The Far
Possibly for a vanity reason, I don't know
But anyway, that's where the Far comes from
For Far Corporation
And for listeners who might not be
Aware of this, Frank was behind
He was a producer and he was involved with
With a lot of bands
You're probably not going to thank me for sharing this with you
Because
When you hear this, you just can't unhear it
Prior to this, he was involved, obviously, with Bony M
And it all came out at the time that he was
Certainly in the studio, he was the
He was the male voice in Ma Baker in What Have You
And he actually features in this track
And like I say, once you hear it
And it makes me wonder, that's all you hear
I'm afraid, I'm sorry, Bony M
Have I ever made you happy?
Have I ever made you happy?
Have I ever made you happy?
Have I ever made you happy?
Have I ever made you happy?
Have I ever made you happy?
A lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there, she knows
If the stores are all closed
Will the world, she can't get what she came for
Ooh
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a soft bird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgivin'
Ooh
And it makes me wonder

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Come be along now
Just a spring clean for May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
Ooh
And it makes me wonder
Ooh
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you, join in
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Just their way lies on the whispering wind
And it makes me wonder
Ooh
And it makes me wonder

And it makes me wonder

Can't let the wind go down the road

With all the wildest money in the world
To feel right is not the right
And it makes me wonder

I'm Jordan Monroe, my home is in fight, but I wanted to make a new start in my life. I was ready to fly to the US of A when a certain wheel I see would say, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe,
oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe,
oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe,
oh no no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
The wild was so sure, I'd not stay and fight But I wanted that lassie to be my sweet wife
So one day we went for a walk down the glen And I asked her all over again
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I got a way that would still hear it fight
But now the sadmer colonies have entered our lives
And never will I let this crib or what like
Take to another site this slow reply
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Your enjoy even up
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
My fear letting
I don't want to go to ride-a-hole
I'd rather stay here and percolate
I'd rather stay here and percolate
I'd rather stay here and percolate
So as I said last week, this section of the show I want to, I've given it the working title,
Geordie Munro simply because of the reference to Kirkcaldy and this is your radio station
so I'm really keen to celebrate what's going on in the community
and like last week there's a bit of a void because I'm just going to do it again,
I'm just going to put a call out for if you're a local organisation, a charity, an individual,
if you're just doing some good and you want the world to know about it then please get in touch
and I'd be more than happy to share whatever you want.
Anyway, so moving on, sorry I was a bit distracted there, a text, in fact a couple of texts have come in,
I thought there might have been a bit of a yellow card, I thought the volume was up there,
I was singing along there, that song actually takes me back to standing in the turntails of Ray Throver's bill,
that song does, not that version, it was the Alexander Brothers that we endured,
which, or should I say it was my singing we had to endure,
so I thought it might have been a yellow card saying look your mic's up, you're singing along,
but no it's saying, hi DJ Carl, loving your show, especially your range of music and the memories of the tracks,
great choices by the way, Janine listening in from Cornwall, England, in Capitals, and it's freezing,
well there you go, I just put a call out for local charities wanting to spread the word,
we truly are, well we're not international but I can say quite confidently now,
we're getting texts from Cornwall so we're at least national.
This next track, going back to what I'm talking about, I thought I'd fill the void this time,
last week it was a local Kirkcaldy band that were very popular at the time in my youth,
I'd go and see, it was the big now, so this week there's another band that I liked really in equal measure,
a band called The Receiving End, and they were fronted by a chap called Danny Holland,
who I guess anybody who was in a band round about the time will certainly know him,
if not from being in the bands, because he was a bit of a nomad, he did play with Blue On Shock,
Locomotive, Lay Night, and of course The Receiving End, and I'm sure there was absolutely a lot more,
and if you didn't know him through the bands, you may have seen him in sleeves,
because he did work for a spell in sleeves.
Anyway, this is track one from a CD I managed to source, again I was rummaging through the attic,
just looking for some material for some local bands, that's the way I operate.
The Receiving End
The Receiving End
Call me whatever you want to
But that's the way I operate
Call me whatever you want to
That's the way I operate
Call me whatever you want to
The Receiving End
I'm learning to fly, cause I know that I can do it
I'll visit the sun at least, that way I'm sure of time
And I'll play any game, but only if I can make a brand new rule book
I'll stay out of mischief, but only if there is many there to get into
Call me whatever you want to
But that's the way I operate
Call me whatever you want to
That's the way I operate
Call me whatever you want to
Call me whatever you want to
But that's the way I operate
Call me whatever you want to
That's the way I operate
Call me whatever you want to
I'm disappearing
In the weirdest of times
I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
Down the straightest of lines
I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
From the CD of the same name, that's the way I operate, back in 1992
And they had quite a, from, if my memory serves me correctly
They had quite a fluid line up with Danny Holland
Of course being the mainstay on vocals and on bass
And that particular track featured Bill Thorne guitars and Ian Douglas on drums
So more from that CD in a moment
But before I do, like I said, I was rummaging about in the attic
It was actually the last week for last week's show
I've come across some amazing demos
Some official releases
But I found quite a curious release
It was a demo cassette
It was a compilation champion
A lot of local bands at the time
Off the top of my head
Obviously The Receiving End
You wouldn't be surprised
It was on that
Because we're doing a feature on The Receiving End
But The Twist
Goodness
Gone blank, you stick a microphone in front of me
And I go blank
Anyway, The Receiving End, we're certainly on it
It was quite an old
Because it was a demo cassette
It wasn't an official release
Anyway, the quality of some of the recordings were better than others
And I guess with the technology and what have you
It was quite hard to restore them
But of the two tracks that were on that
This was the best
The one that sounded the best
And I think it really captures the spirit of the band
This is He's the Man
He's the Man
He's the man
Yesterday painted every square
And chopped this town
Yeah, that's the man
Who yesterday was high
Today he's falling down
Oh, he's the man
Now I remember
That's the man
Now how can I forget
I used to see him standing in the rain
Every time a boy did getting warm
Hey, get up, get up, get up, get up
It's time we were awake
And it's time to coffee break
He's the man
Yesterday turned all conversations inside out
And that's the man
Today saying yesterday
What was I talking about
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Well that's right
Well that's right
That's right
I used to see him standing in the rain, every time before he'd be getting wet
Hey, get up, get up, get up, get up
It's time you were awake, awake
This ain't a coffee break
He's a man, yesterday he painted every square inch of this town
That's a man, who yesterday was high, today he's falling down
He's a man, yesterday he turned all conversations inside out
That's a man, today he's saying yesterday, what was I talking about?
Get up, get up
Here we go, the receiving end, he's a man
and once again that was from the stupefied demo cassette
So the third and final track we're going to play from the receiving end tonight
was lifted from That's the Way I Operate
and it was track 3 from that CD
and before I kicked that track off actually
I had quite a few releases by them and for the life of me
Now it might be buried somewhere in the ears in the attic
but it'd be really nice if somebody could say by the effort of cleaning the attic
I'm trying to source a demo cassette
and I'm absolutely certain it was called Happy as 10
and from memory it included Climb
and I know for a fact it included, it was a live favourite of mine
What's Wrong With Dreaming
So if you have any information
then please, please do get in touch with me
I'd really like to know more
Anyway, Nothing's Wrong
Nothing's wrong
What makes her think that
What makes her think that she belongs
On top of my back
Sometimes I just can't be bothered talking
Is there something seriously wrong with that
So I talk and I just can't be bothered talking
Why do I still catch her looking at me like that
Nothing's wrong
It's the way she pays attention
To the way I hide my eyes
To the way I buckle up my emotions
And lose my heart
?
?
Oh, here she comes
Banging on my door
And I bet she makes her knuckles bleed
And I bet I know what's for
Right here she comes, small bags of complications
She pours out the contents
Onto every spot of the floor
Put me out of minimum mood for conversation
Now it looks like I've just driven her
Straight up to the top of my wall
Nothing's wrong
It's the way she pays attention
To the way I hide my lies
To the way I bottle up my emotions
Inside
It's the way she pays attention
To the way I hide my lies
To the way I bottle up my emotions
Inside
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

From the Sky News centre at nine, Sarkis Dharmas denied trust issues with voters after dropping
many of the policies he campaigned for at the last election. He's been facing interviewer
and audience questions on Sky News' The Battle for Number 10. And he won applause as he attacked
the Tories' record, saying the country's in a worse state than when they started. Meanwhile,
the Prime Minister's also been quizzed, including over his decision to leave a D-Day commemoration
event early.
I was incredibly sad to have caused people hurt and upset. That was actually the last
thing that I wanted to do. And as I said, I hope people can find it in their hearts
to forgive me. When I realised I made a mistake, I apologised.
Police say they're aware an internet prankster has seemingly been registered to stand as
a general election candidate in multiple constituencies. The Electoral Commission says it's investigating.
A court's been told Lucy Letby was caught virtually red-handed by a doctor trying to
kill a baby girl. The former nurse denies attempted murder. But the retrials also heard
her status as a multiple killer is an important piece of evidence.
Greece has shut tourist hotspots and schools across Athens as the first heat wave of the
summer strikes. Temperatures there are tipped to hit highs of 43 Celsius tomorrow.
In sport, Manchester United have reportedly opened contract talks with manager Erik Ten
Hogg. He's staying on after an end-of-season review. The Dutch coach lifted the FA Cup
last month, but presided over the worst-ever Premier League finish. These fans have given
their thoughts about the decision to stick with him.
I don't think he's good enough for the job at Manchester United.
There's been here two seasons, two Cubs. I mean, they're not big Cubs, but it's a trophy
and they're into it.
If we give them a chance and keep them around for a little bit longer, hopefully we get
some more better players. Things turn around quickly.
I think he's a clown. I think he's a clown.
Katie Bolter has reached the quarter-finals of the Nottingham Open tennis, but Heather
Watson won't be joining her. Bolter claimed a straight-sets victory over Canadian Rebecca
Moreno earlier, while Watson suffered defeat to Karolina Plishkova.
That's the latest. I'm Daisy Steele.
The light's still in our eyes We're leaving this old fairground behind
It's a dream that's growing cold The circus never dies
The act forever haunts these skies I know we cannot stay
Farewell to the fairground These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town Until the ice begins to thaw
This place used to gleam I'd seen it in my hopeful dreams
Now I have to get away We move towards the stars
And all that we touch becomes ours Let's keep on till it's day
Farewell to the fairground These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town Until the ice begins to thaw
Will heads out just hold my hand now? I feel like I've casted off my clothes
I'm running through the snow towards the sunset And I'm always with you
Keep on running, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
Keep on running, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
Keep on running, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
Keep on running, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
Farewell to the fairground These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town Until the ice begins to thaw
Will heads out just hold my hand now? I feel like I've casted off my clothes
I'm running through the snow towards the sunset And I'm always with you
Keep on running, keep, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
Farewell to the fairground
You said you've been waiting all alone in my bed
But how long must you wait For some emotion to flow out of my head
How long these walls are so thin I keep my secrets in
But when I took the walls apart I didn't mean to break your heart
You said you've tried everything to get in my head
And you said how long When you open up your eyes to the sun
Well, when come Don't leave me on my own in the skies of Reddentown
Don't leave me all alone Spending endlessly around
You wish I would let you in Well, let me let you in
I'll let you under my skin Just let me let you in
You wish I would let you in Well, let me let you in
I'll let you under my skin Just let me let you in
You said that you're scared of every step that you tread
And you said, like me, everything is not what it may seem
How long until you leave me all alone with my fences falling down
I'll be screaming on my own in this gossip webbing town
You wish I would let you in, well let me let you in
I'll let you under my skin, just let me let you in
You wish I would let you in, well let me let you in
I'll let you under my skin, just let me let you in
You wish I would let you in, well let me let you in
I'll let you under my skin, just let me let you in
I wish I would let you in, let me let you in
I'll let you under my skin, just let me let you in
Okay, second time of asking. I did struggle before that came on. I don't know what came over me.
That's a band called, I'll just take my time this time, Chikinky. They were from Bristol and that was released on Urban Cow Records back in May 2006.
Now it seems of course a little bit confusion. There's just before the news there, I did say here is the news and what with this being my second show.
It's not entirely unreasonable to get a message from HQ saying, what's wrong? You're struggling to play the news. That was of course Electric Light Orchestra. Here is the news.
Yeah, just can't get enough yellow and I'm almost certain I'm going to be playing them again. So yeah, that was then followed by the news and
Hold on a second, I'm just queuing up another record here. The news, White Lies, Farewell to the Fairground and Chikinky.
Yeah, that's a bit of a mouthful. I've got quite a bit of information about them on my website if you check out the Sundown Sessions.
They've released quite a few albums and they've got some, if you like that, you'll almost certainly like everything else that they've put out. This is The Bravery.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, two songs back to back. First one, The Bravery and Honest Mistake.
That was released as a debut and lead single for that matter from their self-titled album 2005. And, you know, it done more or less well. It made the top 10 on the UK singles chart. So it's one that you might be familiar with.
And then from the album Some Cities, The Doves, One of These Days. Now, on a happier note, this next song is often associated with funerals. But before I jump into that, anybody that knows me, I'm, well, if I'm sitting behind the mic, I think it's pretty obvious that I love my music and I'm open to all sorts of genres.
You know, and that includes, excuse me, that includes classical. And I first encountered this next song. It's only two minutes long. It's sad and tragic, but equally beautiful. I mean, it really is. It's something else. And the first time I saw it, it was in a VHS video.
So it's giving you an idea about how long I saw it that I got from Santa. And it was The Doors. Now, the thing about The Doors is, well, they've had quite a few videos over the years, and many of them are live performances.
But this particular one, I guess because Morrison was at UCLA, as were a few of the other band members for that matter, they were very much into their filmmaking. So, you know, at the time, the late 60s, promotional videos were, I wouldn't say they were unique, unique to The Doors.
They were certainly very unusual. Anyway, this particular video was a compilation of live performances and some promotional videos. The track that I'm going to play is actually a reworking of the classical track Adagio.
And it was released after Jim Morrison passed away on the album An American Prayer. And the interpretation, like I say, it's just beautiful. And Jim Morrison is reciting some poetry over it. And yeah, the subject matter maybe is a bit somber, but tragic and beautiful at the same time.
Wow, I'm sick of doubt. Live in light of certain south cruel bindings. The servants have the power. Dog men and their mean women pulling poor blankets over our sailors.
I'm sick of dour faces staring at me from the TV tower. I want roses in my garden bower. Dig, royal babies, rubies must now replace aborted strangers in the mud. These mutants blood me off of the plant that's ploughed.
They are waiting to take us under the severed garden.
You know how pale and wanton and thrillful comes death in a strange hour, unannounced, unplanned for, like a scaring, over-friendly guest you've brought to bed. Death makes angels of us all and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as ravens' claws.
No more money, no more fancy dress. This other kingdom seems by far the best until its other jaw reveals incest and loose obedience to a vegetable law. I will not go. I prefer a feast of friends to the giant family.

So before the adverts you were treated, and I use that in the air quotes, you were treated to Adagio by Jim Morrison in the Doors and that featured on the album An American Prayer.
I actually included a link in the show notes on the Sundown Sessions website pointing to a link to where you can get that video.
If I tried a bit harder I may have actually found that short video, but it was just something else.
The band were out on a yacht just probably off the coast of California, the sun was shining and you were just seeing them and you were just like they've got the world at their feet.
It was at the height of the Doors and it's just sad knowing how things would unravel just only a few years after that.
Anyway after the break there, if you didn't work it out from the title that was Sexy Boy and I make no apology for playing that.
I talked quite extensively last week on my opening show, the inspiration and how I wanted to dedicate that show to the art school dancing programme that was run by my namesake Alistair Gurley.
That was the first time I heard that on that programme and that was Sexy Boy by the French music duo Air.
That was released in 1998 and although it peaked at number 13 in the UK singles chart it actually passed me by at the time.
Now I've just heard a text from Paners in the East Lothian, Paners that could be the Preston Pans I guess.
Great show tonight, can you play Wasteland by the Mission for all us Paners in East Lothian?
Well Joycey, I'm afraid I don't have that to hand but I'll certainly playlist that for you for next week.
But for now you'll have to make do for what I would think are probably the next best thing and certainly flavour of the moment and certainly my record collection.
This is Ist Ist.

I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did. The first time I saw them they were actually supporting the Mission down in Wolverhampton.
That's actually one of the earlier tracks that was lifted from the album architecture way back a couple of years ago.
Let's just say that. Anyway I played them last week and I also played the next artist last week and I make no apology for that.
Nick Cave and the Bad Teeds. They seem to become a bit more commercially accessible really through Peaky Blinders I would say.
The Red Right Hand. And this song is called Jubilee Street.
On Jubilee Street there was a girl named Lee.
She had a history.
But she had no past.
When they shut her down
The Russians moved in
Now I'm too scared
I'm too scared
To even walk on past
She used to say all those good people down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
Yeah they ought to practice just what they preach
Those good people on Jubilee Street
And here I come
Up the hill
I'm pushing my wheel of love
A business gateway. We're already supporting businesses all over Scotland.
And a ten ton catastrophe on a sixty pound chain
And I'm pushing my wheel of love
Jubilee Street
Look at me now
The problem was
She had a little black book
And my name
Was written
On every page
Well a girl's gotta make ends meet
Even down Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time
Up the hill
And out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to practice what I preach
These days I go downtown
In my time tales
I've got a fetus
On a leash
I am alone now
I am beyond recriminations
When curtains are shut
The furniture is gone
I'm transforming
I'm vibrating
I'm glowing
I'm flying
Look at me now
I'm flying
Look at me now

Oops, sorry.
All things that never actually happened, but while listening, you pictured them all, didn't you?
You see, radio uses theatre of the mind and has a one-to-one connection with every single person listening.
So if you want to get your business message across, then there really is no more intimate, creative or cost-effective way than using local radio.
Find out more about advertising on K107 FM now by going to k107.co.uk
And we won't send our fire breathing, water boiling, toaster popping crowd over to see you.
Yeah, and once again, that's not real.
Local radio advertising, try it today.
There you go, the power of radio indeed.
There you go.
So far we've hit Cornwall, the Pans, Leith and hometown Kirkcaldy.
If you want to get in touch, there's still time.
I'm here till 10 o'clock.
You can send me a text on 07723 58 1687.
Anyway, now that the admin's out the road, the track that we just listened to there was Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.
And that was Jubilee Street from the album Push the Sky Away, released back in 2013.
I actually went to see him.
In fact, I've actually seen Nick Cave in various incarnations a number of times over the years, be it Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, of course.
Nick Cave with Warren Ellis and as the kind of side project grinder man.
And each time, you know, I've been quite impressed.
But the tour when they were pushing, when they were promoting Push the Sky Away, it was electric.
That's all I can say.
I mean, it was almost like it was evangelical.
The power that Nick Cave had over the audience was just you really have to see it to believe it.
It really was something else.
And I'm really eagerly waiting on the new album that's due to be released on the 30th of August.
World God.
And I've got some information about you can actually preorder that.
I've got links and the show notes of the show.
So if you just like I say, if you go to sundownsessions.co.uk, you'll find out more there.
Now, next up, there's two big things that have come out of Grangemouth.
I'd say one is a petrochemical plant and this is without doubt the other one.
The drugs, the horses.
The phytoncide, all of a sudden.
The police, the police, the police, the police.
The police, the police, the police, the police.
The police, the police, the police, the police.
The police, the police, the police, the police.
The police, the police, the police.
The police, the police, the police.
Here you go, from the album Tiny Dynamine.
That's Pink Orange Red by the Cocktail Twins.
That's probably one of the biggest acts to come out of Grangemouth.
And a little bit closer to home.
I was actually going to touch on this during the Geordie Monroe section,
but I thought no, I'll hang off because the ink's not quite dry on this deal yet.
But I'm actually just too excited, so I need to share it.
I'm absolutely thrilled to say that Andy's Man Club, or somebody from Andy's Man Club,
is going to be coming out shortly in the next few weeks.
The details have yet to be firmed up.
I'm going to have a bit of a chat, talk about what they're all about.
And if you can't wait, I have included some information again in the show notes.
So details about what Andy's Man Club are and also some ways, if you know about them
and you're keen to help raise money for their cause,
there's the Delamere Family Running Challenge.
And there's also, if you're not quite ready for a 10K here and now,
there's plenty of time to train for one because they're organising,
slash hosting an event, the Hardin Forest 10K, in September of this year.
So I've got my running shoes laced up for that.
I've certainly got my eye on it.
Anyway, I just couldn't keep that to myself any longer.
I just had to get that out there.
Back to the music.
This next song is Masters of Reality and it's a particular favourite of mine.
It's from Masters of the Suffer Bus.
This is 100 Years of Tears to the Wind.
Thank you.
OK, the anticipation was probably, yeah, you probably couldn't get over the anticipation there.
I didn't actually realise that we had a bit of radio silence there.
It was playing absolutely fine through the monitor here.
Yeah, but the hamsters are in the hamster wheel and they're trying to sort that out in the meantime.
Let's try again.
This is the cult.
Life is greater than death.
You break the man
Leave his shell on the ground
What have you done
With your own life
Your words
Share everything I've seen
Speak everything I've seen
So kill your jealousy
What you believe
You can't destroy them
The beauty and the youth
You'll never beat them
You'll never hide the truth
You can't destroy them
The beauty and the youth
You'll never beat them
You'll never hide the truth
I lay down
With the beasts on the ground
The prophets cry
In every tear
A prayer forever
Share everything I've seen
Speak everything I've seen
So kill your jealousy
And what you still believe
You can't destroy them
The beauty and the youth
You'll never beat them
You'll never hide the truth
Destroy, destroy, destroy them
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
What I've done
You'll never beat them
Why you destroy everything
So beautiful in your hand
Can you feel it
Come on
The hate strips it away
The essence of a man
Weave a golden noose
And hang you from the stars
Hey now
There you go, what's it to say
About a bad workman blames his tools
Yep, yep, just press the wrong button there
So, second time, actually third time lucky
Because I had two stabs at that earlier
Third time lucky, fingers crossed
Here we go, this time, Masters of Reality
100 years of tears to the wind
Hey now
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Beneath your head
I found my place in bed
Three feet beneath your head
You know, I've got to really, I had four stabs
Four stabs that played that record
And I feel each and every time
I had four goes at it because I just like it so much
But you know what, we've just run out of time
So I'm definitely going to play that next week
Playlist it next week, okay
Music
There you go, saved all my stakes up for the end tonight
And it is government's track record
After being accused of a catalogue of broken promises
For migration and the NHS
