[02:53.400 --> 02:58.360]  Well, good evening and welcome. My name's Collin Gurley and you're listening to the Fundown Sessions
[02:58.360 --> 03:04.680]  live on K107. And I just want to thank Collette there for making that handover quite seamless and
[03:04.680 --> 03:09.880]  I'm delighted to say that while she helped me put that record on, she's still going to speak to me. So
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.400]  I happen to like it, but that's the beauty about music. It's all subjective, isn't it?
[03:15.400 --> 03:21.400]  Anyway, if we still get any stragglers listening from the Letter Rocks show, that song will
[03:21.400 --> 03:23.400]  almost certainly be familiar to you.
[03:23.400 --> 03:27.840]  I was going to say originally by Deep Purple, but it wasn't originally, it's actually been
[03:27.840 --> 03:29.400]  covered quite a few times.
[03:29.400 --> 03:34.160]  It was Cooley Shaker's Biggest Sit, that's what you just listened to, written by Joe
[03:34.160 --> 03:43.040]  South for the Billy Joe Royal and subsequently covered by somebody's image in 67 and of course
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.760]  Deep Purple in 1968 and yeah, Cooley Shaker.
[03:47.760 --> 03:49.080]  I quite like that version.
[03:49.080 --> 03:56.560]  Anyway, kicking off the show, I thought that it might be quite interesting to, especially
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.640]  after the discussion with Collette, I'm not going to make a bold claim and say that I'm
[04:01.640 --> 04:05.560]  going to play cover versions that are better than the originals.
[04:05.560 --> 04:09.560]  Let's just say they're interesting.
[04:09.560 --> 04:15.560]  And I certainly think this holds true to this Decks record, that's certainly what Frankie
[04:15.560 --> 04:16.560]  says anyway.
[05:10.560 --> 05:18.560]  When you let me in I want to be your friend I want to guide your dreams and visions
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.560]  Just wrap your legs around, spell the hymns and
[05:22.560 --> 05:27.560]  Shake your hands, got my engines Together we could break this trap
[05:27.560 --> 05:32.560]  We run till we drop and baby we'll never go back
[05:33.560 --> 05:37.560]  Oh, you'll walk with me out of the wild
[05:37.560 --> 05:40.560]  Cause baby I'm a scared and lonely rider
[05:40.560 --> 05:43.560]  I've got to know how it feels
[05:43.560 --> 05:45.560]  I want to know love's wild
[05:45.560 --> 05:50.560]  I want to know that love is real
[05:50.560 --> 05:54.560]  Oh, you'll walk with me out of the wild
[05:54.560 --> 05:58.560]  Cause baby I'm a scared and lonely rider
[05:58.560 --> 06:02.560]  I've got to know how it feels
[06:02.560 --> 06:05.560]  I want to know love's wild
[06:05.560 --> 06:09.560]  I want to know that love is real
[06:09.560 --> 06:13.560]  Cause baby I'm a scared and lonely rider
[06:13.560 --> 06:17.560]  I've got to know how it feels
[06:17.560 --> 06:20.560]  On the palace, semi-powered drones
[06:20.560 --> 06:22.560]  Scream down the boulevard
[06:22.560 --> 06:26.560]  Girls comb their hair and review mirrors
[06:26.560 --> 06:29.560]  And the boys try to look so hot
[06:29.560 --> 06:32.560]  The amusement park rises bold and soft
[06:32.560 --> 06:35.560]  Kids are huddled on a beach in the mist
[06:35.560 --> 06:38.560]  I want to die with you when you're on the street tonight
[06:38.560 --> 06:42.560]  In an everlasting kiss
[06:47.560 --> 06:50.560]  Ah, ah, ah
[06:50.560 --> 06:53.560]  Highways share with broken heroes
[06:53.560 --> 06:56.560]  On a last stand powered drive
[06:56.560 --> 06:59.560]  Everybody sign on the run tonight
[06:59.560 --> 07:02.560]  But there's no place left to hide
[07:02.560 --> 07:06.560]  Today I'm a scared and lonely rider
[07:06.560 --> 07:09.560]  I've got to know love's wild
[07:09.560 --> 07:13.560]  I want to know love's wild
[07:13.560 --> 07:16.560]  But there's no place left to hide
[07:16.560 --> 07:19.560]  Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
[07:19.560 --> 07:24.560]  I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
[07:24.560 --> 07:28.560]  Oh, someday, girl, I don't know where
[07:28.560 --> 07:32.560]  We'll get to the place that we really wanna go
[07:32.560 --> 07:36.560]  And we'll walk in the sun, but till then
[07:36.560 --> 07:42.560]  Baby, we were born to run
[07:42.560 --> 07:47.560]  Baby, we were born to run
[07:47.560 --> 07:54.560]  Champs like us, baby, we were born to run
[07:55.560 --> 07:59.560]  Oh, oh, oh, oh
[08:03.560 --> 08:07.560]  Champs like us, baby, we were born to run
[08:25.560 --> 08:28.560]  It was a very, very short gig, of course, Relax featured
[08:28.560 --> 08:34.560]  And it was really when Frankie were quite the phenomenon
[08:34.560 --> 08:38.560]  And, yeah, I happen to think that's better than the original
[08:38.560 --> 08:40.560]  I'm gonna go out on the limb and say that
[08:40.560 --> 08:44.560]  That was originally a Bruce Springsteen song
[08:44.560 --> 08:50.560]  Featured on, in fact, it was the name of his third album, Born to Run, 1975
[08:50.560 --> 08:58.560]  Let me know what you think. You can text me on 0772-358-1687
[09:20.560 --> 09:23.560]  Now Ziggy played guitar
[09:23.560 --> 09:26.560]  Charming good with grit and gilly
[09:26.560 --> 09:29.560]  And the spiders from Mars
[09:29.560 --> 09:32.560]  He played it left hand
[09:32.560 --> 09:35.560]  But made it too far
[09:35.560 --> 09:38.560]  Became the special man
[09:38.560 --> 09:42.560]  Then we were Ziggy's band
[09:42.560 --> 09:44.560]  And Ziggy will listen
[09:44.560 --> 09:48.560]  Screw the pies and screw down the hairdo
[09:48.560 --> 09:51.560]  Like a cat from Japan
[09:51.560 --> 09:54.560]  He could lick on by smiling
[09:54.560 --> 09:57.560]  He could even turn
[09:57.560 --> 10:00.560]  Came on some loaded man
[10:00.560 --> 10:04.560]  A well hung and snow-white tan
[10:05.560 --> 10:08.560]  Now where were the spiders?
[10:10.560 --> 10:14.560]  While the flies tried to break up our halls
[10:15.560 --> 10:19.560]  Just a mere light to guide us
[10:19.560 --> 10:22.560]  So we fixed about his band
[10:22.560 --> 10:25.560]  And should we cross his sweet hand
[10:37.560 --> 10:39.560]  Ziggy played for time
[10:39.560 --> 10:43.560]  Driving us that we were build to
[10:43.560 --> 10:45.560]  The kids were just crass
[10:45.560 --> 10:48.560]  Oh, he was the mess
[10:48.560 --> 10:51.560]  With god-giver ass
[10:52.560 --> 10:54.560]  He'd talk it all too far
[10:54.560 --> 10:58.560]  But boy, could he play guitar
[10:59.560 --> 11:02.560]  Making love with his ego
[11:04.560 --> 11:08.560]  Ziggy is sucked up into his mind
[11:09.560 --> 11:12.560]  Like a leper messiah
[11:13.560 --> 11:16.560]  When the kids had killed the man
[11:16.560 --> 11:19.560]  I had to break up the band
[11:25.560 --> 11:27.560]  Oh yeah
[11:28.560 --> 11:30.560]  Oh yeah
[11:34.560 --> 11:39.560]  Now Ziggy plays guitar
[11:57.560 --> 11:59.560]  Now Ziggy plays guitar
[12:08.560 --> 12:10.560]  Ziggy starred us, of course
[12:10.560 --> 12:13.560]  And that version was by Bauhaus
[12:13.560 --> 12:16.560]  I was a bit too young at the time when that came out
[12:16.560 --> 12:18.560]  It was back in 1982
[12:18.560 --> 12:20.560]  And I didn't really appreciate them, like I say
[12:20.560 --> 12:22.560]  Because they were a bit too young
[12:22.560 --> 12:24.560]  But they released their final studio album
[12:24.560 --> 12:28.560]  Right, I think it was about 2006, 2008
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.560]  It was the noughties anyway, that's for sure
[12:32.560 --> 12:36.560]  And that certainly reignited my interest in Bauhaus
[12:36.560 --> 12:39.560]  And then I started digging back in the back catalogue
[12:39.560 --> 12:42.560]  And started to understand that there's a bit more to them
[12:42.560 --> 12:44.560]  Than just kicking the eye
[12:44.560 --> 12:46.560]  Now, this next track
[12:46.560 --> 12:49.560]  I did give out the studio text number
[12:49.560 --> 12:53.560]  And I need to put a disclaimer in first
[12:53.560 --> 12:56.560]  Before I start this
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.560]  Before I'm accused of sort of making a
[13:03.560 --> 13:05.560]  Quite a radical comment
[13:05.560 --> 13:07.560]  When I did say that
[13:07.560 --> 13:11.560]  I think these covers are better in some cases
[13:11.560 --> 13:13.560]  I'd say they're interesting
[13:13.560 --> 13:16.560]  This one that I'm going to play is by Far Corporation
[13:16.560 --> 13:19.560]  I think it's interesting for me on a very personal level
[13:19.560 --> 13:21.560]  Because it's
[13:21.560 --> 13:24.560]  When I first really discovered Led Zeppelin
[13:24.560 --> 13:26.560]  Indirectly through this record
[13:27.560 --> 13:29.560]  And there was a lot of
[13:29.560 --> 13:31.560]  There was a lot of interest when
[13:31.560 --> 13:33.560]  Stairway to Heaven, the single
[13:33.560 --> 13:36.560]  Was released at the time, not least because it was
[13:36.560 --> 13:39.560]  It was quite new at the time, it was 1985
[13:39.560 --> 13:42.560]  And it was, I guess, the first kind of supergroup
[13:42.560 --> 13:45.560]  I mean, if you look on the back of the single
[13:45.560 --> 13:48.560]  It reads like a movie credit list
[13:48.560 --> 13:51.560]  The amount of musicians that were involved in this
[13:52.560 --> 13:54.560]  The ones that stick in my mind were
[13:54.560 --> 13:57.560]  There was quite a few members from Toto amongst others
[13:57.560 --> 14:00.560]  The interesting thing about this is
[14:00.560 --> 14:02.560]  It's called Far Corporation
[14:02.560 --> 14:06.560]  And this supergroup was assembled by Frank Farian
[14:06.560 --> 14:08.560]  The Far
[14:08.560 --> 14:10.560]  Possibly for a vanity reason, I don't know
[14:10.560 --> 14:12.560]  But anyway, that's where the Far comes from
[14:12.560 --> 14:14.560]  For Far Corporation
[14:14.560 --> 14:17.560]  And for listeners who might not be
[14:17.560 --> 14:20.560]  Aware of this, Frank was behind
[14:20.560 --> 14:23.560]  He was a producer and he was involved with
[14:23.560 --> 14:24.560]  With a lot of bands
[14:24.560 --> 14:27.560]  You're probably not going to thank me for sharing this with you
[14:27.560 --> 14:29.560]  Because
[14:29.560 --> 14:32.560]  When you hear this, you just can't unhear it
[14:32.560 --> 14:35.560]  Prior to this, he was involved, obviously, with Bony M
[14:35.560 --> 14:39.560]  And it all came out at the time that he was
[14:39.560 --> 14:42.560]  Certainly in the studio, he was the
[14:42.560 --> 14:45.560]  He was the male voice in Ma Baker in What Have You
[14:45.560 --> 14:48.560]  And he actually features in this track
[14:48.560 --> 14:51.560]  And like I say, once you hear it
[14:51.560 --> 14:54.560]  And it makes me wonder, that's all you hear
[14:54.560 --> 14:57.560]  I'm afraid, I'm sorry, Bony M
[15:15.560 --> 15:20.560]  Have I ever made you happy?
[15:20.560 --> 15:25.560]  Have I ever made you happy?
[15:25.560 --> 15:30.560]  Have I ever made you happy?
[15:30.560 --> 15:35.560]  Have I ever made you happy?
[15:35.560 --> 15:40.560]  Have I ever made you happy?
[15:40.560 --> 15:44.560]  Have I ever made you happy?
[15:44.560 --> 15:46.560]  A lady who's sure
[15:46.560 --> 15:49.560]  All that glitters is gold
[15:49.560 --> 15:55.560]  And she's buying a stairway to heaven
[15:55.560 --> 15:58.560]  When she gets there, she knows
[15:58.560 --> 16:01.560]  If the stores are all closed
[16:01.560 --> 16:07.560]  Will the world, she can't get what she came for
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.560]  Ooh
[16:12.560 --> 16:18.560]  And she's buying a stairway to heaven
[16:18.560 --> 16:21.560]  There's a sign on the wall
[16:21.560 --> 16:24.560]  But she wants to be sure
[16:24.560 --> 16:30.560]  Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
[16:30.560 --> 16:33.560]  In a tree by the brook
[16:33.560 --> 16:36.560]  There's a soft bird who sings
[16:36.560 --> 16:42.560]  Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgivin'
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.560]  Ooh
[16:47.560 --> 16:54.560]  And it makes me wonder
[16:54.560 --> 16:59.560]  Ooh
[16:59.560 --> 17:06.560]  And it makes me wonder
[17:06.560 --> 17:11.560]  Ooh
[17:11.560 --> 17:18.560]  And it makes me wonder
[17:18.560 --> 17:23.560]  Ooh
[17:23.560 --> 17:29.560]  And it makes me wonder
[17:53.560 --> 17:58.560]  Ooh
[17:58.560 --> 18:03.560]  And it makes me wonder
[18:03.560 --> 18:08.560]  Ooh
[18:08.560 --> 18:13.560]  And it makes me wonder
[18:13.560 --> 18:18.560]  Ooh
[18:18.560 --> 18:23.560]  And it makes me wonder
[18:23.560 --> 18:28.560]  Ooh
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.560]  And it makes me wonder
[18:33.560 --> 18:38.560]  Ooh
[18:38.560 --> 18:43.560]  And it makes me wonder
[18:43.560 --> 18:47.560]  Ooh
[18:47.560 --> 18:52.560]  And it makes me wonder
[18:52.560 --> 18:54.560]  Ooh
[18:54.560 --> 19:00.560]  And it makes me wonder
[19:00.560 --> 19:03.560]  If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
[19:03.560 --> 19:05.560]  Come be along now
[19:05.560 --> 19:09.560]  Just a spring clean for May Queen
[19:09.560 --> 19:12.560]  Yes, there are two paths you can go by
[19:12.560 --> 19:14.560]  But in the long run
[19:14.560 --> 19:20.560]  There's still time to change the road you're on
[19:20.560 --> 19:25.560]  Ooh
[19:25.560 --> 19:30.560]  And it makes me wonder
[19:30.560 --> 19:35.560]  Ooh
[19:35.560 --> 19:40.560]  And it makes me wonder
[19:41.560 --> 19:44.560]  Your head is humming and it won't go
[19:44.560 --> 19:46.560]  In case you don't know
[19:46.560 --> 19:50.560]  The piper's calling you, join in
[19:50.560 --> 19:53.560]  Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
[19:53.560 --> 19:55.560]  And did you know
[19:55.560 --> 20:07.560]  Just their way lies on the whispering wind
[20:10.560 --> 20:15.560]  And it makes me wonder
[20:15.560 --> 20:20.560]  Ooh
[20:20.560 --> 20:25.560]  And it makes me wonder
[20:25.560 --> 20:30.560]  Ooh
[20:30.560 --> 20:35.560]  And it makes me wonder
[20:35.560 --> 20:40.560]  Ooh
[20:40.560 --> 20:45.560]  And it makes me wonder
[20:45.560 --> 20:50.560]  Ooh
[20:50.560 --> 20:55.560]  And it makes me wonder
[20:55.560 --> 21:00.560]  Ooh
[21:00.560 --> 21:05.560]  And it makes me wonder
[21:05.560 --> 21:10.560]  And it makes me wonder
[21:10.560 --> 21:15.560]  Ooh
[21:15.560 --> 21:20.560]  And it makes me wonder
[21:20.560 --> 21:25.560]  Ooh
[21:25.560 --> 21:30.560]  And it makes me wonder
[21:30.560 --> 21:35.560]  Ooh
[21:35.560 --> 21:40.560]  Can't let the wind go down the road
[21:40.560 --> 21:45.560]  And it makes me wonder
[21:45.560 --> 21:48.560]  Ooh
[21:48.560 --> 21:53.560]  And it makes me wonder
[21:53.560 --> 21:58.560]  Ooh
[21:58.560 --> 22:03.560]  And it makes me wonder
[22:03.560 --> 22:07.560]  Ooh
[22:07.560 --> 22:12.560]  With all the wildest money in the world
[22:12.560 --> 22:20.560]  To feel right is not the right
[22:20.560 --> 22:24.560]  And it makes me wonder
[22:24.560 --> 22:30.560]  Ooh
[22:30.560 --> 22:35.560]  And it makes me wonder
[22:35.560 --> 22:39.560]  And it makes me wonder
[22:39.560 --> 22:42.560]  And it makes me wonder
[22:42.560 --> 22:45.560]  And it makes me wonder
[22:45.560 --> 22:49.560]  And it makes me wonder
[22:49.560 --> 22:53.560]  And it makes me wonder
[22:53.560 --> 22:58.560]  And it makes me wonder
[22:58.560 --> 23:03.560]  And it makes me wonder
[23:03.560 --> 23:33.560]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[25:01.420 --> 25:31.420]  I'm Jordan Monroe, my home is in fight, but I wanted to make a new start in my life. I was ready to fly to the US of A when a certain wheel I see would say, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
[25:31.420 --> 25:36.260]  Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
[25:36.260 --> 25:38.640]  Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe,
[25:38.640 --> 25:42.480]  oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe,
[25:42.480 --> 25:44.780]  oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
[25:44.780 --> 25:46.680]  Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
[25:46.680 --> 25:49.640]  Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
[25:49.640 --> 25:51.680]  Jordan Monroe, oh no no no, Jordan Monroe,
[25:51.680 --> 25:54.120]  oh no no no no, Jordan Monroe, oh no no no,
[25:54.120 --> 26:06.120]  The wild was so sure, I'd not stay and fight But I wanted that lassie to be my sweet wife
[26:06.120 --> 26:13.120]  So one day we went for a walk down the glen And I asked her all over again
[26:13.120 --> 26:43.120]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[26:43.120 --> 26:46.020]  I got a way that would still hear it fight
[26:46.340 --> 26:49.840]  But now the sadmer colonies have entered our lives
[26:49.840 --> 26:53.460]  And never will I let this crib or what like
[26:53.460 --> 26:57.020]  Take to another site this slow reply
[26:57.820 --> 27:00.740]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[27:00.740 --> 27:02.820]  Your enjoy even up
[27:04.720 --> 27:07.740]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[27:07.740 --> 27:09.940]  My fear letting
[27:09.940 --> 27:17.940]  I don't want to go to ride-a-hole
[27:17.940 --> 27:24.940]  I'd rather stay here and percolate
[27:24.940 --> 27:34.940]  I'd rather stay here and percolate
[27:39.940 --> 27:54.940]  I'd rather stay here and percolate
[27:54.940 --> 28:01.940]  So as I said last week, this section of the show I want to, I've given it the working title,
[28:01.940 --> 28:10.940]  Geordie Munro simply because of the reference to Kirkcaldy and this is your radio station
[28:10.940 --> 28:15.940]  so I'm really keen to celebrate what's going on in the community
[28:15.940 --> 28:21.940]  and like last week there's a bit of a void because I'm just going to do it again,
[28:21.940 --> 28:27.940]  I'm just going to put a call out for if you're a local organisation, a charity, an individual,
[28:27.940 --> 28:33.940]  if you're just doing some good and you want the world to know about it then please get in touch
[28:33.940 --> 28:40.940]  and I'd be more than happy to share whatever you want.
[28:40.940 --> 28:49.940]  Anyway, so moving on, sorry I was a bit distracted there, a text, in fact a couple of texts have come in,
[28:49.940 --> 28:53.940]  I thought there might have been a bit of a yellow card, I thought the volume was up there,
[28:53.940 --> 29:00.940]  I was singing along there, that song actually takes me back to standing in the turntails of Ray Throver's bill,
[29:00.940 --> 29:05.940]  that song does, not that version, it was the Alexander Brothers that we endured,
[29:05.940 --> 29:10.940]  which, or should I say it was my singing we had to endure,
[29:10.940 --> 29:14.940]  so I thought it might have been a yellow card saying look your mic's up, you're singing along,
[29:14.940 --> 29:22.940]  but no it's saying, hi DJ Carl, loving your show, especially your range of music and the memories of the tracks,
[29:22.940 --> 29:30.940]  great choices by the way, Janine listening in from Cornwall, England, in Capitals, and it's freezing,
[29:30.940 --> 29:38.940]  well there you go, I just put a call out for local charities wanting to spread the word,
[29:38.940 --> 29:43.940]  we truly are, well we're not international but I can say quite confidently now,
[29:43.940 --> 29:47.940]  we're getting texts from Cornwall so we're at least national.
[29:48.940 --> 29:55.940]  This next track, going back to what I'm talking about, I thought I'd fill the void this time,
[29:55.940 --> 30:01.940]  last week it was a local Kirkcaldy band that were very popular at the time in my youth,
[30:01.940 --> 30:08.940]  I'd go and see, it was the big now, so this week there's another band that I liked really in equal measure,
[30:08.940 --> 30:13.940]  a band called The Receiving End, and they were fronted by a chap called Danny Holland,
[30:13.940 --> 30:19.940]  who I guess anybody who was in a band round about the time will certainly know him,
[30:19.940 --> 30:25.940]  if not from being in the bands, because he was a bit of a nomad, he did play with Blue On Shock,
[30:25.940 --> 30:30.940]  Locomotive, Lay Night, and of course The Receiving End, and I'm sure there was absolutely a lot more,
[30:30.940 --> 30:34.940]  and if you didn't know him through the bands, you may have seen him in sleeves,
[30:34.940 --> 30:38.940]  because he did work for a spell in sleeves.
[30:38.940 --> 30:46.940]  Anyway, this is track one from a CD I managed to source, again I was rummaging through the attic,
[30:46.940 --> 30:55.940]  just looking for some material for some local bands, that's the way I operate.
[31:08.940 --> 31:13.940]  The Receiving End
[31:38.940 --> 31:43.940]  The Receiving End
[32:08.940 --> 32:13.940]  Call me whatever you want to
[32:13.940 --> 32:16.940]  But that's the way I operate
[32:16.940 --> 32:21.940]  Call me whatever you want to
[32:21.940 --> 32:24.940]  That's the way I operate
[32:24.940 --> 32:28.940]  Call me whatever you want to
[32:38.940 --> 32:42.940]  The Receiving End
[32:54.940 --> 32:58.940]  I'm learning to fly, cause I know that I can do it
[32:58.940 --> 33:03.940]  I'll visit the sun at least, that way I'm sure of time
[33:09.940 --> 33:16.940]  And I'll play any game, but only if I can make a brand new rule book
[33:16.940 --> 33:25.940]  I'll stay out of mischief, but only if there is many there to get into
[33:25.940 --> 33:30.940]  Call me whatever you want to
[33:30.940 --> 33:33.940]  But that's the way I operate
[33:33.940 --> 33:37.940]  Call me whatever you want to
[33:37.940 --> 33:40.940]  That's the way I operate
[33:40.940 --> 33:44.940]  Call me whatever you want to
[34:07.940 --> 34:11.940]  Call me whatever you want to
[34:11.940 --> 34:14.940]  But that's the way I operate
[34:14.940 --> 34:19.940]  Call me whatever you want to
[34:19.940 --> 34:22.940]  That's the way I operate
[34:22.940 --> 34:26.940]  Call me whatever you want to
[34:37.940 --> 34:39.940]  I'm disappearing
[34:39.940 --> 34:41.940]  In the weirdest of times
[34:41.940 --> 34:43.940]  I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
[34:43.940 --> 34:45.940]  Down the straightest of lines
[34:45.940 --> 34:47.940]  I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
[34:47.940 --> 34:49.940]  I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
[34:49.940 --> 34:51.940]  I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
[34:51.940 --> 34:53.940]  I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
[34:53.940 --> 34:55.940]  I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
[34:55.940 --> 34:57.940]  I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
[34:57.940 --> 34:59.940]  I walk in a sick, saggy fashion
[34:59.940 --> 35:01.940]  La la la la la
[35:01.940 --> 35:03.940]  La la la la la
[35:03.940 --> 35:05.940]  La la la la la
[35:05.940 --> 35:07.940]  La la la la la
[35:07.940 --> 35:11.940]  From the CD of the same name, that's the way I operate, back in 1992
[35:11.940 --> 35:15.940]  And they had quite a, from, if my memory serves me correctly
[35:15.940 --> 35:19.940]  They had quite a fluid line up with Danny Holland
[35:19.940 --> 35:24.940]  Of course being the mainstay on vocals and on bass
[35:24.940 --> 35:30.940]  And that particular track featured Bill Thorne guitars and Ian Douglas on drums
[35:30.940 --> 35:34.940]  So more from that CD in a moment
[35:34.940 --> 35:38.940]  But before I do, like I said, I was rummaging about in the attic
[35:38.940 --> 35:40.940]  It was actually the last week for last week's show
[35:40.940 --> 35:44.940]  I've come across some amazing demos
[35:44.940 --> 35:46.940]  Some official releases
[35:46.940 --> 35:48.940]  But I found quite a curious release
[35:48.940 --> 35:50.940]  It was a demo cassette
[35:50.940 --> 35:52.940]  It was a compilation champion
[35:52.940 --> 35:54.940]  A lot of local bands at the time
[35:54.940 --> 35:56.940]  Off the top of my head
[35:56.940 --> 35:58.940]  Obviously The Receiving End
[35:58.940 --> 36:00.940]  You wouldn't be surprised
[36:00.940 --> 36:02.940]  It was on that
[36:02.940 --> 36:04.940]  Because we're doing a feature on The Receiving End
[36:04.940 --> 36:06.940]  But The Twist
[36:06.940 --> 36:08.940]  Goodness
[36:08.940 --> 36:10.940]  Gone blank, you stick a microphone in front of me
[36:10.940 --> 36:12.940]  And I go blank
[36:12.940 --> 36:14.940]  Anyway, The Receiving End, we're certainly on it
[36:14.940 --> 36:16.940]  It was quite an old
[36:16.940 --> 36:18.940]  Because it was a demo cassette
[36:18.940 --> 36:20.940]  It wasn't an official release
[36:20.940 --> 36:25.940]  Anyway, the quality of some of the recordings were better than others
[36:25.940 --> 36:28.940]  And I guess with the technology and what have you
[36:28.940 --> 36:30.940]  It was quite hard to restore them
[36:30.940 --> 36:33.940]  But of the two tracks that were on that
[36:33.940 --> 36:35.940]  This was the best
[36:35.940 --> 36:37.940]  The one that sounded the best
[36:37.940 --> 36:39.940]  And I think it really captures the spirit of the band
[36:39.940 --> 36:41.940]  This is He's the Man
[36:50.940 --> 36:52.940]  He's the Man
[37:10.940 --> 37:11.940]  He's the man
[37:11.940 --> 37:13.940]  Yesterday painted every square
[37:13.940 --> 37:15.940]  And chopped this town
[37:17.940 --> 37:18.940]  Yeah, that's the man
[37:18.940 --> 37:19.940]  Who yesterday was high
[37:19.940 --> 37:22.940]  Today he's falling down
[37:23.940 --> 37:24.940]  Oh, he's the man
[37:24.940 --> 37:25.940]  Now I remember
[37:25.940 --> 37:26.940]  That's the man
[37:26.940 --> 37:28.940]  Now how can I forget
[37:30.940 --> 37:32.940]  I used to see him standing in the rain
[37:32.940 --> 37:35.940]  Every time a boy did getting warm
[37:37.940 --> 37:39.940]  Hey, get up, get up, get up, get up
[37:39.940 --> 37:44.940]  It's time we were awake
[37:45.940 --> 37:48.940]  And it's time to coffee break
[37:50.940 --> 37:51.940]  He's the man
[37:51.940 --> 37:55.940]  Yesterday turned all conversations inside out
[37:57.940 --> 37:58.940]  And that's the man
[37:58.940 --> 38:00.940]  Today saying yesterday
[38:00.940 --> 38:03.940]  What was I talking about
[38:03.940 --> 38:05.940]  Get up
[38:07.940 --> 38:08.940]  Get up
[38:14.940 --> 38:15.940]  Get up
[38:15.940 --> 38:16.940]  Get up
[38:16.940 --> 38:17.940]  Get up
[38:17.940 --> 38:18.940]  Get up
[38:18.940 --> 38:19.940]  Get up
[38:19.940 --> 38:20.940]  Get up
[38:20.940 --> 38:21.940]  Get up
[38:21.940 --> 38:22.940]  Get up
[38:22.940 --> 38:23.940]  Get up
[38:23.940 --> 38:24.940]  Get up
[38:24.940 --> 38:25.940]  Get up
[38:25.940 --> 38:26.940]  Get up

[38:28.940 --> 38:29.940]  Get up
[38:29.940 --> 38:30.940]  Get up
[38:30.940 --> 38:31.940]  Get up
[38:31.940 --> 38:32.940]  Get up
[38:32.940 --> 38:33.940]  Get up
[38:33.940 --> 38:34.940]  Get up
[38:34.940 --> 38:35.940]  Get up
[38:35.940 --> 38:36.940]  Get up
[38:36.940 --> 38:37.940]  Get up
[38:37.940 --> 38:38.940]  Get up
[38:38.940 --> 38:39.940]  Get up
[38:39.940 --> 38:40.940]  Get up
[38:40.940 --> 38:41.940]  Get up
[38:42.940 --> 38:43.940]  Get up
[38:43.940 --> 38:44.940]  Get up
[38:45.940 --> 38:46.940]  Get up
[38:48.940 --> 38:49.940]  Get up
[38:52.940 --> 38:53.940]  Get up
[38:55.940 --> 38:56.940]  Get up
[38:58.940 --> 38:59.940]  Get up
[39:02.940 --> 39:04.940]  Well that's right
[39:06.940 --> 39:07.940]  Well that's right
[39:09.940 --> 39:10.940]  That's right
[39:11.940 --> 39:29.940]  I used to see him standing in the rain, every time before he'd be getting wet
[39:29.940 --> 39:32.940]  Hey, get up, get up, get up, get up
[39:32.940 --> 39:38.940]  It's time you were awake, awake
[39:38.940 --> 39:42.940]  This ain't a coffee break
[39:56.940 --> 40:02.940]  He's a man, yesterday he painted every square inch of this town
[40:02.940 --> 40:09.940]  That's a man, who yesterday was high, today he's falling down
[40:09.940 --> 40:15.940]  He's a man, yesterday he turned all conversations inside out
[40:15.940 --> 40:22.940]  That's a man, today he's saying yesterday, what was I talking about?
[40:22.940 --> 40:27.940]  Get up, get up
[40:33.940 --> 40:38.940]  Here we go, the receiving end, he's a man
[40:38.940 --> 40:42.940]  and once again that was from the stupefied demo cassette
[40:42.940 --> 40:46.940]  So the third and final track we're going to play from the receiving end tonight
[40:46.940 --> 40:49.940]  was lifted from That's the Way I Operate
[40:49.940 --> 40:52.940]  and it was track 3 from that CD
[40:52.940 --> 40:56.940]  and before I kicked that track off actually
[40:56.940 --> 41:01.940]  I had quite a few releases by them and for the life of me
[41:01.940 --> 41:04.940]  Now it might be buried somewhere in the ears in the attic
[41:04.940 --> 41:08.940]  but it'd be really nice if somebody could say by the effort of cleaning the attic
[41:08.940 --> 41:11.940]  I'm trying to source a demo cassette
[41:11.940 --> 41:14.940]  and I'm absolutely certain it was called Happy as 10
[41:14.940 --> 41:16.940]  and from memory it included Climb
[41:16.940 --> 41:20.940]  and I know for a fact it included, it was a live favourite of mine
[41:20.940 --> 41:22.940]  What's Wrong With Dreaming
[41:22.940 --> 41:26.940]  So if you have any information
[41:26.940 --> 41:29.940]  then please, please do get in touch with me
[41:29.940 --> 41:31.940]  I'd really like to know more
[41:31.940 --> 41:33.940]  Anyway, Nothing's Wrong
[41:59.940 --> 42:07.940]  Nothing's wrong
[42:07.940 --> 42:13.940]  What makes her think that
[42:13.940 --> 42:17.940]  What makes her think that she belongs
[42:17.940 --> 42:23.940]  On top of my back
[42:23.940 --> 42:27.940]  Sometimes I just can't be bothered talking
[42:27.940 --> 42:32.940]  Is there something seriously wrong with that
[42:32.940 --> 42:36.940]  So I talk and I just can't be bothered talking
[42:36.940 --> 42:42.940]  Why do I still catch her looking at me like that
[42:42.940 --> 42:46.940]  Nothing's wrong
[42:46.940 --> 42:50.940]  It's the way she pays attention
[42:50.940 --> 42:54.940]  To the way I hide my eyes
[42:54.940 --> 42:58.940]  To the way I buckle up my emotions
[42:58.940 --> 43:02.940]  And lose my heart
[43:02.940 --> 43:12.940]  ?
[43:12.940 --> 43:22.940]  ?
[43:22.940 --> 43:26.940]  Oh, here she comes
[43:26.940 --> 43:31.940]  Banging on my door
[43:31.940 --> 43:35.940]  And I bet she makes her knuckles bleed
[43:35.940 --> 43:39.940]  And I bet I know what's for
[43:41.940 --> 43:45.940]  Right here she comes, small bags of complications
[43:45.940 --> 43:47.940]  She pours out the contents
[43:47.940 --> 43:51.940]  Onto every spot of the floor
[43:51.940 --> 43:55.940]  Put me out of minimum mood for conversation
[43:55.940 --> 43:57.940]  Now it looks like I've just driven her
[43:57.940 --> 44:00.940]  Straight up to the top of my wall
[44:00.940 --> 44:02.940]  Nothing's wrong
[44:04.940 --> 44:08.940]  It's the way she pays attention
[44:08.940 --> 44:12.940]  To the way I hide my lies
[44:12.940 --> 44:17.940]  To the way I bottle up my emotions
[44:17.940 --> 44:20.940]  Inside
[44:30.940 --> 44:35.940]  It's the way she pays attention
[44:35.940 --> 44:40.940]  To the way I hide my lies
[44:40.940 --> 44:45.940]  To the way I bottle up my emotions
[44:45.940 --> 44:47.940]  Inside
[45:01.940 --> 45:04.940]  La la la la la la la la la la la

[45:35.940 --> 45:38.940]  The standard of service, attention to detail,

[55:36.400 --> 55:39.880]  fond ones of a time that was actually on Egypt who were making their way to the
[55:39.880 --> 55:47.720]  Giza pyramids and yeah that was really when I discovered Muse. My wife likes to
[55:47.720 --> 55:52.480]  think that she discovered them but I'm just going to keep hold of that title I
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.560]  think I discovered. Anyway, I feel like I'm rambling. What time is it? It's 2058, my
[55:57.560 --> 56:03.000]  goodness. Time flies when you enjoy yourself. Here is the news.
[56:37.400 --> 56:41.400]  Here is the news.
[56:43.400 --> 56:48.400]  Coming to you every hour upon the hour. Here is the news.
[56:50.400 --> 56:54.400]  The weather's fine, but there may be a medium shower.
[56:54.400 --> 56:56.400]  Here is the news.
[57:01.400 --> 57:03.400]  Here is the news.
[57:04.400 --> 57:07.400]  A cure's been found, a good old rocket lag.
[57:08.400 --> 57:10.400]  Here is the news.

[57:38.200 --> 57:40.400]  Here is the news.
[57:40.400 --> 57:47.160]  From the Sky News centre at nine, Sarkis Dharmas denied trust issues with voters after dropping
[57:47.160 --> 57:51.820]  many of the policies he campaigned for at the last election. He's been facing interviewer
[57:51.820 --> 57:57.040]  and audience questions on Sky News' The Battle for Number 10. And he won applause as he attacked
[57:57.040 --> 58:01.760]  the Tories' record, saying the country's in a worse state than when they started. Meanwhile,
[58:01.760 --> 58:06.400]  the Prime Minister's also been quizzed, including over his decision to leave a D-Day commemoration
[58:06.400 --> 58:07.400]  event early.
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.720]  I was incredibly sad to have caused people hurt and upset. That was actually the last
[58:11.720 --> 58:16.080]  thing that I wanted to do. And as I said, I hope people can find it in their hearts
[58:16.080 --> 58:19.520]  to forgive me. When I realised I made a mistake, I apologised.
[58:19.520 --> 58:23.440]  Police say they're aware an internet prankster has seemingly been registered to stand as
[58:23.440 --> 58:30.160]  a general election candidate in multiple constituencies. The Electoral Commission says it's investigating.
[58:30.160 --> 58:34.240]  A court's been told Lucy Letby was caught virtually red-handed by a doctor trying to
[58:34.240 --> 58:39.080]  kill a baby girl. The former nurse denies attempted murder. But the retrials also heard
[58:39.080 --> 58:42.960]  her status as a multiple killer is an important piece of evidence.
[58:42.960 --> 58:46.960]  Greece has shut tourist hotspots and schools across Athens as the first heat wave of the
[58:46.960 --> 58:51.960]  summer strikes. Temperatures there are tipped to hit highs of 43 Celsius tomorrow.
[58:51.960 --> 58:56.440]  In sport, Manchester United have reportedly opened contract talks with manager Erik Ten
[58:56.440 --> 59:01.040]  Hogg. He's staying on after an end-of-season review. The Dutch coach lifted the FA Cup
[59:01.040 --> 59:06.440]  last month, but presided over the worst-ever Premier League finish. These fans have given
[59:06.440 --> 59:09.160]  their thoughts about the decision to stick with him.
[59:09.160 --> 59:11.160]  I don't think he's good enough for the job at Manchester United.
[59:11.160 --> 59:15.040]  There's been here two seasons, two Cubs. I mean, they're not big Cubs, but it's a trophy
[59:15.040 --> 59:16.040]  and they're into it.
[59:16.040 --> 59:19.640]  If we give them a chance and keep them around for a little bit longer, hopefully we get
[59:19.640 --> 59:22.160]  some more better players. Things turn around quickly.
[59:22.160 --> 59:24.920]  I think he's a clown. I think he's a clown.
[59:24.920 --> 59:28.200]  Katie Bolter has reached the quarter-finals of the Nottingham Open tennis, but Heather
[59:28.200 --> 59:32.360]  Watson won't be joining her. Bolter claimed a straight-sets victory over Canadian Rebecca
[59:32.360 --> 59:37.880]  Moreno earlier, while Watson suffered defeat to Karolina Plishkova.
[59:37.880 --> 59:40.040]  That's the latest. I'm Daisy Steele.
[59:58.200 --> 01:00:10.040]  The light's still in our eyes We're leaving this old fairground behind
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:14.440]  It's a dream that's growing cold The circus never dies
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:21.480]  The act forever haunts these skies I know we cannot stay
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:29.720]  Farewell to the fairground These rides aren't working anymore
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:37.720]  Goodbye to this dead town Until the ice begins to thaw
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:49.960]  This place used to gleam I'd seen it in my hopeful dreams
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.960]  Now I have to get away We move towards the stars
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:01:01.960]  And all that we touch becomes ours Let's keep on till it's day
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:10.200]  Farewell to the fairground These rides aren't working anymore
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:18.200]  Goodbye to this dead town Until the ice begins to thaw
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:25.720]  Will heads out just hold my hand now? I feel like I've casted off my clothes
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:33.960]  I'm running through the snow towards the sunset And I'm always with you
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:58.200]  Keep on running, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:06.440]  Keep on running, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:14.440]  Keep on running, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:40.680]  Keep on running, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:48.920]  Farewell to the fairground These rides aren't working anymore
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:56.920]  Goodbye to this dead town Until the ice begins to thaw
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:03.160]  Will heads out just hold my hand now? I feel like I've casted off my clothes
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:11.160]  I'm running through the snow towards the sunset And I'm always with you
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:47.160]  Keep on running, keep, keep, keep on running There's no place like home, there's no place like home
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.160]  Farewell to the fairground
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:51.160]  You said you've been waiting all alone in my bed
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:05:03.400]  But how long must you wait For some emotion to flow out of my head
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:11.400]  How long these walls are so thin I keep my secrets in
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:21.640]  But when I took the walls apart I didn't mean to break your heart
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:29.640]  You said you've tried everything to get in my head
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:41.880]  And you said how long When you open up your eyes to the sun
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:50.880]  Well, when come Don't leave me on my own in the skies of Reddentown
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:57.880]  Don't leave me all alone Spending endlessly around
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:06.600]  You wish I would let you in Well, let me let you in
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:12.600]  I'll let you under my skin Just let me let you in
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:18.600]  You wish I would let you in Well, let me let you in
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:25.400]  I'll let you under my skin Just let me let you in
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:37.400]  You said that you're scared of every step that you tread
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:50.400]  And you said, like me, everything is not what it may seem
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:58.400]  How long until you leave me all alone with my fences falling down
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:06.400]  I'll be screaming on my own in this gossip webbing town
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:15.400]  You wish I would let you in, well let me let you in
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.400]  I'll let you under my skin, just let me let you in
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:27.400]  You wish I would let you in, well let me let you in
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.400]  I'll let you under my skin, just let me let you in
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:52.400]  You wish I would let you in, well let me let you in
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:59.400]  I'll let you under my skin, just let me let you in
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:05.400]  I wish I would let you in, let me let you in
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:11.400]  I'll let you under my skin, just let me let you in
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.400]  Okay, second time of asking. I did struggle before that came on. I don't know what came over me.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:33.400]  That's a band called, I'll just take my time this time, Chikinky. They were from Bristol and that was released on Urban Cow Records back in May 2006.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:43.400]  Now it seems of course a little bit confusion. There's just before the news there, I did say here is the news and what with this being my second show.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:55.400]  It's not entirely unreasonable to get a message from HQ saying, what's wrong? You're struggling to play the news. That was of course Electric Light Orchestra. Here is the news.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:08.400]  Yeah, just can't get enough yellow and I'm almost certain I'm going to be playing them again. So yeah, that was then followed by the news and
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:18.400]  Hold on a second, I'm just queuing up another record here. The news, White Lies, Farewell to the Fairground and Chikinky.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:26.400]  Yeah, that's a bit of a mouthful. I've got quite a bit of information about them on my website if you check out the Sundown Sessions.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:39.400]  They've released quite a few albums and they've got some, if you like that, you'll almost certainly like everything else that they've put out. This is The Bravery.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:21.400]  Yeah.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:46.400]  Yeah.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:11:11.400]  Yeah.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:36.400]  Yeah.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:12:01.400]  Yeah.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:23.400]  Yeah.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:51.400]  Yeah.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:13:13.400]  Yeah.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:46.400]  Yeah.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:14:11.400]  Yeah.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:36.400]  Yeah.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:15:04.400]  Yeah.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:32.400]  Yeah.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:57.400]  Yeah.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:25.400]  Yeah.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:50.400]  Yeah.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:17:15.400]  Yeah.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:40.400]  Yeah.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:59.400]  Oh, two songs back to back. First one, The Bravery and Honest Mistake.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:13.400]  That was released as a debut and lead single for that matter from their self-titled album 2005. And, you know, it done more or less well. It made the top 10 on the UK singles chart. So it's one that you might be familiar with.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:40.400]  And then from the album Some Cities, The Doves, One of These Days. Now, on a happier note, this next song is often associated with funerals. But before I jump into that, anybody that knows me, I'm, well, if I'm sitting behind the mic, I think it's pretty obvious that I love my music and I'm open to all sorts of genres.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:19:01.400]  You know, and that includes, excuse me, that includes classical. And I first encountered this next song. It's only two minutes long. It's sad and tragic, but equally beautiful. I mean, it really is. It's something else. And the first time I saw it, it was in a VHS video.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:18.400]  So it's giving you an idea about how long I saw it that I got from Santa. And it was The Doors. Now, the thing about The Doors is, well, they've had quite a few videos over the years, and many of them are live performances.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:39.400]  But this particular one, I guess because Morrison was at UCLA, as were a few of the other band members for that matter, they were very much into their filmmaking. So, you know, at the time, the late 60s, promotional videos were, I wouldn't say they were unique, unique to The Doors.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:57.400]  They were certainly very unusual. Anyway, this particular video was a compilation of live performances and some promotional videos. The track that I'm going to play is actually a reworking of the classical track Adagio.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:24.400]  And it was released after Jim Morrison passed away on the album An American Prayer. And the interpretation, like I say, it's just beautiful. And Jim Morrison is reciting some poetry over it. And yeah, the subject matter maybe is a bit somber, but tragic and beautiful at the same time.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:44.400]  Wow, I'm sick of doubt. Live in light of certain south cruel bindings. The servants have the power. Dog men and their mean women pulling poor blankets over our sailors.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:21:12.400]  I'm sick of dour faces staring at me from the TV tower. I want roses in my garden bower. Dig, royal babies, rubies must now replace aborted strangers in the mud. These mutants blood me off of the plant that's ploughed.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:38.400]  They are waiting to take us under the severed garden.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:58.400]  You know how pale and wanton and thrillful comes death in a strange hour, unannounced, unplanned for, like a scaring, over-friendly guest you've brought to bed. Death makes angels of us all and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as ravens' claws.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:21.400]  No more money, no more fancy dress. This other kingdom seems by far the best until its other jaw reveals incest and loose obedience to a vegetable law. I will not go. I prefer a feast of friends to the giant family.

[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:49.400]  One day, I will be beautiful like a moon.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.400]  Fancy blind.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.400]  Fancy blind.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.400]  Fancy blind.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.400]  Fancy blind.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.400]  Fancy blind.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:26.400]  Fancy blind.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.400]  Fancy blind.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.400]  Fancy blind.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:27:03.400]  I don't know if I'm going to make it, but I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.380]  going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:12.840]  going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:24.360]  to make it, and I'm going to make it, and I'm going to make it, and the
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:32.360]  Sexy boy
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:40.360]  Sexy boy
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:49.360]  Sexy boy
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:57.360]  Sexy boy
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:05.360]  Sexy boy
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:14.360]  Sexy boy
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:24.360]  Sexy boy
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:30.360]  Sexy boy
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:44.360]  So before the adverts you were treated, and I use that in the air quotes, you were treated to Adagio by Jim Morrison in the Doors and that featured on the album An American Prayer.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:53.360]  I actually included a link in the show notes on the Sundown Sessions website pointing to a link to where you can get that video.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:29:01.360]  If I tried a bit harder I may have actually found that short video, but it was just something else.
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:11.360]  The band were out on a yacht just probably off the coast of California, the sun was shining and you were just seeing them and you were just like they've got the world at their feet.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:20.360]  It was at the height of the Doors and it's just sad knowing how things would unravel just only a few years after that.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:32.360]  Anyway after the break there, if you didn't work it out from the title that was Sexy Boy and I make no apology for playing that.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:48.360]  I talked quite extensively last week on my opening show, the inspiration and how I wanted to dedicate that show to the art school dancing programme that was run by my namesake Alistair Gurley.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:55.360]  That was the first time I heard that on that programme and that was Sexy Boy by the French music duo Air.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:30:02.360]  That was released in 1998 and although it peaked at number 13 in the UK singles chart it actually passed me by at the time.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:16.360]  Now I've just heard a text from Paners in the East Lothian, Paners that could be the Preston Pans I guess.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:21.360]  Great show tonight, can you play Wasteland by the Mission for all us Paners in East Lothian?
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:29.360]  Well Joycey, I'm afraid I don't have that to hand but I'll certainly playlist that for you for next week.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:39.360]  But for now you'll have to make do for what I would think are probably the next best thing and certainly flavour of the moment and certainly my record collection.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.360]  This is Ist Ist.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:31:05.360]  This is Ist Ist.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:25.360]  This is Ist Ist.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:45.360]  This is Ist Ist.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:57.360]  This is Ist Ist.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:17.360]  This is Ist Ist.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:37.360]  This is Ist Ist.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:57.360]  This is Ist Ist.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:17.360]  This is Ist Ist.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:24.360]  I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did. The first time I saw them they were actually supporting the Mission down in Wolverhampton.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:35.360]  That's actually one of the earlier tracks that was lifted from the album architecture way back a couple of years ago.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:42.360]  Let's just say that. Anyway I played them last week and I also played the next artist last week and I make no apology for that.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:51.360]  Nick Cave and the Bad Teeds. They seem to become a bit more commercially accessible really through Peaky Blinders I would say.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:57.360]  The Red Right Hand. And this song is called Jubilee Street.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:26.360]  On Jubilee Street there was a girl named Lee.
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:32.360]  She had a history.
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:39.360]  But she had no past.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:44.360]  When they shut her down
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:53.360]  The Russians moved in
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:57.360]  Now I'm too scared
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.360]  I'm too scared
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:07.360]  To even walk on past
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:13.360]  She used to say all those good people down on Jubilee Street
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:23.360]  They ought to practice what they preach
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:29.360]  Yeah they ought to practice just what they preach
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:33.360]  Those good people on Jubilee Street
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.360]  And here I come
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:39.360]  Up the hill
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:47.360]  I'm pushing my wheel of love
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:55.360]  A business gateway. We're already supporting businesses all over Scotland.
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:03.360]  And a ten ton catastrophe on a sixty pound chain
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.360]  And I'm pushing my wheel of love
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.360]  Jubilee Street
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.360]  Look at me now
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:58.360]  The problem was
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:05.360]  She had a little black book
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.360]  And my name
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:11.360]  Was written
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:17.360]  On every page
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:21.360]  Well a girl's gotta make ends meet
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:28.360]  Even down Jubilee Street
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.360]  I was out of place and time
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.360]  Up the hill
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:37.360]  And out of my mind
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:43.360]  On Jubilee Street
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:53.360]  I ought to practice what I preach
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.360]  These days I go downtown
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:05.360]  In my time tales
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:10.360]  I've got a fetus
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:16.360]  On a leash
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:20.360]  I am alone now
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.360]  I am beyond recriminations
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:27.360]  When curtains are shut
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.360]  The furniture is gone
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.360]  I'm transforming
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.360]  I'm vibrating
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.360]  I'm glowing
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.360]  I'm flying
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:43.360]  Look at me now
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360]  I'm flying
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.360]  Look at me now
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.360]  I'm flying
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.360]  Look at me now
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.360]  I'm flying
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.360]  Look at me now
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360]  I'm flying
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360]  Look at me now
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360]  I'm flying
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.360]  Look at me now
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.360]  I'm flying
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.360]  Look at me now
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.360]  I'm flying
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.360]  Look at me now
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.360]  I'm flying
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.360]  I'm flying
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:25.360]  At Business Gateway, we're already supporting businesses all over Scotland.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:29.360]  Every step of my business, Business Gateway, has been there.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:35.360]  If there's something I don't know about or I need a bit of help, I know that my Business Gateway advisor is always at the other end of the phone.

[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.360]  The power of radio
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.360]  Bad weather
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:54.360]  At the racetrack
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.360]  In the shower
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.360]  Oops, sorry.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:02.360]  All things that never actually happened, but while listening, you pictured them all, didn't you?
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:08.360]  You see, radio uses theatre of the mind and has a one-to-one connection with every single person listening.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:15.360]  So if you want to get your business message across, then there really is no more intimate, creative or cost-effective way than using local radio.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:21.360]  Find out more about advertising on K107 FM now by going to k107.co.uk
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.360]  And we won't send our fire breathing, water boiling, toaster popping crowd over to see you.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.360]  Yeah, and once again, that's not real.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:31.360]  Local radio advertising, try it today.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.360]  There you go, the power of radio indeed.
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.360]  There you go.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:43.360]  So far we've hit Cornwall, the Pans, Leith and hometown Kirkcaldy.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.360]  If you want to get in touch, there's still time.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.360]  I'm here till 10 o'clock.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:54.360]  You can send me a text on 07723 58 1687.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:03.360]  Anyway, now that the admin's out the road, the track that we just listened to there was Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:08.360]  And that was Jubilee Street from the album Push the Sky Away, released back in 2013.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.360]  I actually went to see him.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:19.360]  In fact, I've actually seen Nick Cave in various incarnations a number of times over the years, be it Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, of course.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:25.360]  Nick Cave with Warren Ellis and as the kind of side project grinder man.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.360]  And each time, you know, I've been quite impressed.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:38.360]  But the tour when they were pushing, when they were promoting Push the Sky Away, it was electric.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.360]  That's all I can say.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.360]  I mean, it was almost like it was evangelical.
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:49.360]  The power that Nick Cave had over the audience was just you really have to see it to believe it.
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.360]  It really was something else.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:43:00.360]  And I'm really eagerly waiting on the new album that's due to be released on the 30th of August.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.360]  World God.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:05.360]  And I've got some information about you can actually preorder that.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.360]  I've got links and the show notes of the show.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:14.360]  So if you just like I say, if you go to sundownsessions.co.uk, you'll find out more there.
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:20.360]  Now, next up, there's two big things that have come out of Grangemouth.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:26.360]  I'd say one is a petrochemical plant and this is without doubt the other one.
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:18.360]  The drugs, the horses.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:29.360]  The phytoncide, all of a sudden.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:50.360]  The police, the police, the police, the police.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:20.360]  The police, the police, the police, the police.
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:44.360]  The police, the police, the police, the police.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:46:04.360]  The police, the police, the police, the police.
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:24.360]  The police, the police, the police.
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:54.360]  The police, the police, the police.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:47:18.360]  Here you go, from the album Tiny Dynamine.
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:22.360]  That's Pink Orange Red by the Cocktail Twins.
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:25.360]  That's probably one of the biggest acts to come out of Grangemouth.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.360]  And a little bit closer to home.
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:32.360]  I was actually going to touch on this during the Geordie Monroe section,
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:38.360]  but I thought no, I'll hang off because the ink's not quite dry on this deal yet.
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:43.360]  But I'm actually just too excited, so I need to share it.
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:48.360]  I'm absolutely thrilled to say that Andy's Man Club, or somebody from Andy's Man Club,
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:51.360]  is going to be coming out shortly in the next few weeks.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.360]  The details have yet to be firmed up.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.360]  I'm going to have a bit of a chat, talk about what they're all about.
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:05.360]  And if you can't wait, I have included some information again in the show notes.
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:14.360]  So details about what Andy's Man Club are and also some ways, if you know about them
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:18.360]  and you're keen to help raise money for their cause,
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.360]  there's the Delamere Family Running Challenge.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.360]  And there's also, if you're not quite ready for a 10K here and now,
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.360]  there's plenty of time to train for one because they're organising,
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:38.360]  slash hosting an event, the Hardin Forest 10K, in September of this year.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.360]  So I've got my running shoes laced up for that.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:43.360]  I've certainly got my eye on it.
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:46.360]  Anyway, I just couldn't keep that to myself any longer.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.360]  I just had to get that out there.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.360]  Back to the music.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:56.360]  This next song is Masters of Reality and it's a particular favourite of mine.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:59.360]  It's from Masters of the Suffer Bus.
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:02.360]  This is 100 Years of Tears to the Wind.
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.360]  Thank you.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:50:04.360]  OK, the anticipation was probably, yeah, you probably couldn't get over the anticipation there.
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:09.360]  I didn't actually realise that we had a bit of radio silence there.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:12.360]  It was playing absolutely fine through the monitor here.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:18.360]  Yeah, but the hamsters are in the hamster wheel and they're trying to sort that out in the meantime.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.360]  Let's try again.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.360]  This is the cult.
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.360]  Life is greater than death.
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:51:09.360]  You break the man
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:18.360]  Leave his shell on the ground
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:22.360]  What have you done
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:26.360]  With your own life
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:29.360]  Your words
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:35.360]  Share everything I've seen
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:41.360]  Speak everything I've seen
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:46.360]  So kill your jealousy
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:52.360]  What you believe
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:56.360]  You can't destroy them
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:04.360]  The beauty and the youth
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:07.360]  You'll never beat them
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:15.360]  You'll never hide the truth
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:19.360]  You can't destroy them
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:27.360]  The beauty and the youth
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:31.360]  You'll never beat them
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:52.360]  You'll never hide the truth
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:55.360]  I lay down
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:04.360]  With the beasts on the ground
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:07.360]  The prophets cry
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:10.360]  In every tear
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:14.360]  A prayer forever
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:20.360]  Share everything I've seen
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:26.360]  Speak everything I've seen
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:32.360]  So kill your jealousy
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:37.360]  And what you still believe
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:41.360]  You can't destroy them
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:49.360]  The beauty and the youth
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:53.360]  You'll never beat them
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:54:02.360]  You'll never hide the truth
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:06.360]  Destroy, destroy, destroy them
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:09.360]  Can you feel it
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:12.360]  Can you feel it
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:13.360]  Can you feel it
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:14.360]  What I've done
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:17.360]  You'll never beat them
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:19.360]  Why you destroy everything
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:23.360]  So beautiful in your hand
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.360]  Can you feel it
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.360]  Come on
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:36.360]  The hate strips it away
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:42.360]  The essence of a man
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.360]  Weave a golden noose
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:55.360]  And hang you from the stars
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:58.360]  Hey now
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.360]  There you go, what's it to say
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:05.360]  About a bad workman blames his tools
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:09.360]  Yep, yep, just press the wrong button there
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:12.360]  So, second time, actually third time lucky
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:15.360]  Because I had two stabs at that earlier
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:17.360]  Third time lucky, fingers crossed
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:20.360]  Here we go, this time, Masters of Reality
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:24.360]  100 years of tears to the wind
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.360]  Hey now
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:28.360]  Can you feel it
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:29.360]  Can you feel it
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.360]  Beneath your head
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:36.360]  I found my place in bed
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:46.360]  Three feet beneath your head
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:50.360]  You know, I've got to really, I had four stabs
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.360]  Four stabs that played that record
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:55.360]  And I feel each and every time
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:58.360]  I had four goes at it because I just like it so much
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:00.360]  But you know what, we've just run out of time
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:04.360]  So I'm definitely going to play that next week
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:07.360]  Playlist it next week, okay
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:42.360]  Music
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.360]  There you go, saved all my stakes up for the end tonight
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:46.360]  And it is government's track record
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:49.360]  After being accused of a catalogue of broken promises
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.360]  For migration and the NHS
