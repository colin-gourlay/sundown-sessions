OPENING OF SHOW

November 1984 I wrote to Santa...

revolutionized home computing in the 1980s by making technology accessible and 'affordable' to the masses. 
It inspired a generation of coders, gamers, and developers, fostering a DIY programming culture. 
Despite its technical limitations, it became a hub for creativity, with thousands of games and 
software titles. Its impact on the UK tech and gaming industries cemented its legendary status, 
earning it a nostalgic following that persists today.

Changed my life - Chris Sievey from The Freshies otherwise known as Frank Sidebottom wrote a 
game called The Biz. The objective of the game was to get a record to number 1. 

So, my claim to fame is that I was selling in excess of 50,000 copies of a record a week 

Fast forward to November 2024 and I left a stack of hints around the house and Mrs Claus says I have to 
wait and see.

My corner of the internet is on fire seeing all these 50 somethings going gaga over this. Argos sold out.
Amazon sold out... the way Christmas falls I will share an update on the Hogmany show whether I was a good boy

All that being said... we're here for the music and 1984 was a special year for music too.

The Fall

"Victoria" is a cover of the song originally by The Kinks, performed by The Fall, one of the most influential post-punk bands. The Fall's version was released in 1988 as part of their album The Frenz Experiment. This rendition showcases the band’s raw, energetic style and Mark E. Smith's distinctive vocal delivery, adding a gritty edge to the original.

The song was also released as a single and became one of The Fall's most successful tracks, reaching #35 on the UK Singles Chart.

Pylon

"Crazy" by Pylon is one of the band's most iconic tracks, originally released in 1981 as a single. Known for its infectious energy and minimalist post-punk style, the song captures the Athens, Georgia band's distinctive blend of angular guitar riffs, driving basslines, and Vanessa Briscoe Hay's urgent, yelping vocals.

Lyrically, Crazy reflects themes of emotional intensity and disconnection, aligning with the raw, introspective spirit of the post-punk era. The track gained wider recognition when it was covered by R.E.M. in 1987 as a B-side to their single Driver 8, introducing Pylon's music to a broader audience.

"Crazy" remains a cult favorite and a testament to Pylon's lasting influence on the indie and post-punk scenes, solidifying their legacy as pioneers in the Athens music scene alongside bands like R.E.M. and The B-52's.

PRIME MOVERS

"On The Trail" was picked up by BBC Radio One who played it as if it were a number one single. Demand to see the band in the UK was such that a hastily arranged press tour was soon followed by a British tour as support act for Big Country. 

The band recorded at producer Robin Millar's studio, The Power Plant, in London. With Big Country finishing up work on their album, The Seer, in the studio next door, The Prime Movers asked new friend Stuart Adamson to lay down a guitar part on "Dark Western Night." He lent his trademark E-Bow (bagpipe) guitar sound to the single. 

In March 1986, The Prime Movers embarked on a 15 date UK Tour as special guests of Big Country. "The Seer" Tour was buoyed by the strength of a number seven charting single, "Look Away," and all shows were sold out including two packed nights at London's fabled Hammersmith Odeon. The tour was a huge success and The Prime Mover's "Dark Western Night" was repackaged by Island as a twelve-inch, yellow vinyl, double set with record two being live recordings from the tour.
