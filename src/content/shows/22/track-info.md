1. Tuesday Night @ East Coast FM - cant believe its December. That time of year, when for the next 20 days Michael Buble comes out for his seasonal outing across the airwaves. Try as he might he is not going to appear on this show. In fact, for the next 2 hours I'm putting him back in the cupboard under lock and key because here @ the Sundown Sessions we only play the finest music to grace our turntables through the decades
2. Revue by Squeeze, from their 1979 album Cool for Cats, 
   3. before I give out the text number I have a bit of an ask... followers will noticed that I put out a teaser, this week is no exception and with White China playing this weekend it seemed right to mark that with a White China special if you like... all but exhausted the material I have off them after tonight so drop me a text or add a comment on the page what youre most excited to hear. You might just mention a track I'm not aware of highlighting a gap in my record collection that needs filled.
   4. either way, give us a text even if its just to say hello and you want a wee mention on the radio!
3. "Three Girl Rhumba," a track from their 1977 album Pink Flag,
    i. Elastica's 1994 hit "Connection," from their self-titled debut album, prominently uses a riff nearly identical to the one in "Three Girl Rhumba," albeit transposed down a semitone. This similarity led to legal action by Wire, resulting in an out-of-court settlement.
4. Monochrome Set - 
5. Shop Assistants - Somewhere In China, cover appeared on Fish Heads and Tails, released in 1989
6. The Way I Walk - The Way I Walk is a 1994 EP featuring a cover of Jack Scott's 1959 rockabilly hit of the same name. 
   7. This version marked a notable shift for the band, as it was the first track to feature guitarist 
   8. John Duncan on lead vocals - i do remember reading an interview where, at the time, he was a bit
   9. cynical of the release made just to capitalise on the fact that he had been working with Kurt Kobain 
   10. and Nirvana on a tour (he was Cobains guitar technician) that might have changed because they 
   11. do, on occasion, play it live. The B side features a couple of other tracks one of particular note is a great version 
   12. of "Sick Baby ('94)" 
7. Restless Natives
   8. How do I pick my favourite BC song? Picked for me when I saw The Clown & The Wolfman musical 
   9. happening next year at Perth - leave kitchen information
   10. Song I always struggled to play - Bruce Watson on you tube. 
   11. Bigcountry.info - great divide podcast & tabbed 
12. Last week I played Porrohman - explain why its special, youtube video on show notes
13. Mike Peters what a front man. What an absolute inspiration, despite everything he is going through he still turning up to the BC gigs on their Steeltown anniversary tour supporting them. I really do wish him well. 
14. Got a USB stick of that gig an up until the tail end of last week that gig took a new lease of life and I'll tell you why right after this - this is electrk circus
