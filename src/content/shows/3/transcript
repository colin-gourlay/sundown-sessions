Too many teardrops, for one heart to be crying Too many teardrops, for one heart to carry on
You're way on top now, since you left me You're always laughing, way down at me
But watch out now, I'm gonna get down And we'll be together for just a little while
And then I'm gonna put you way down here And you'll start crying 96 tears
Cry, you're gonna cry And when the sun comes up, I'll be on top
You'll be right down there, looking up I'm gonna get to you, but I don't know
You're gonna cry, 96 tears You're gonna cry, 96 tears
You're gonna cry, 96 tears You're gonna cry, 96 tears
Too many teardrops, all my love Too many teardrops
Cry, cry, cry, cry now You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
96 tears All my love
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now 96 tears Cry, cry, cry now 96 tears Cry, cry, cry now 96 tears
You're gonna cry, 96 tears You're gonna cry, 96 tears
Well, it was on my car on the way in
I was listening to one of her shows on the Listen Again feature
That you can find actually on the website
And I was actually, I fell off my seat
She was interviewing Slash and yes, it was that Slash
But that's not actually, I fell off my seat
I should add, I wasn't driving at this point
She was interviewing Tommy Paxton
Who's now vocals and guitar with Big Country
And I'll explain a little bit more why
Why that actually means an awful lot to me later on in the show
Anyway, back to my show
Again, yeah, sundown sessions
We kicked the show off with The Stranglers
And that was 96 tears
Originally recorded by Question Mark and The Mysterians
But this particular version that we listened to
Reached number 17 in the UK singles chart
And we're going to follow up with
Kind of following a little bit on a similar theme as last week
If you tuned in last week
We opened the show with a few cover versions
That I perhaps foolishly claimed that they were better than the originals
I'd still argue that Born to Run by Frankie Goes to Hollywood is better
But anyway, that's the beauty about music
It's all subjective
So I'm not going to make such a bold claim
I'm however going to play a few covers
And rather than me pass judgement on this particular one
I'm actually going to quote
I'm going to quote Trent Reznor
Who actually wrote this song
And it appeared on the Nine Inch Nails second album
The Downward Spiral
Is of course the hurt that I'm referring to
And Reznor has been noticed
In praising Cash's interpretation of the song
For its sincerity and meaning
Going on to say that the song just isn't his anymore
I mean, what better endorsement could you get?
This is Johnny Cash
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears the hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
There's Johnny Cash and Hurt.
When that was released back in 2002,
it was received with much commercial and critical acclaim.
The related music video is considered by many to be
one of the greatest of all time by publications such as NME.
And I've got to, by way of a confession,
I wouldn't say even up to that point when I saw that,
I could actually take or leave Johnny Cash.
Country music, as much as I was
going on at length about how I was open to all genres of music,
genres of music rather, last week,
country music never really seemed to grab me until
I went to Nashville a few years ago.
And at the time I was heading out and we were doing the
what you really ought to do when you're out there.
We went to Memphis, done Graceland, and it was more in my mind.
When I came, when we went there, it felt like more of a holiday
and it was just like it was a bucket list thing that you have to do.
But really by the time I came away from Nashville,
I just felt like it's a pilgrimage that anybody
that really cares for music,
you know, you should make a point of getting out there.
It's absolutely something else.
The Grand Ole Opry up until I'd been there, I was like,
nah, it's not for me.
But I was just absolutely blown away.
And while I've not yet hit the floor on the line dancing scene,
I do have a particular soft spot for country music.
And I thought I'd play that one because it's part of that trip.
We went into the Johnny Cash Museum and after visiting it,
I was actually not surprised to learn that it was like
the number one music museum in the world
before it was in the National Geographic Traveler.
It really is something else.
And without really giving too much away, if you haven't been,
and I've somehow inspired you to go, that video,
that track actually plays quite a prominent part in that museum.
And like I say, that turned me on to Johnny Cash
and country music.
Anyway, while we're on the other side of the Atlantic
and still dealing with covers, I think if anybody ever, ever
does a decent job of the Mail Brothers and actually gets away,
in my opinion, gets away with the vocal of Russell Mail,
then you really need to sit up and pay attention.
This is Billy Mackenzie.
music
When she's on her best behaviour
Don't be tempted by her favours
Never turn your back on mother earth
Tells her from May to be by hands
That looked so smooth to me
She'll never turn your back on mother earth
Crasped straws that toe across me
Gaze at clouds that come to cross
She'll never turn your back on mother earth
Three days and two nights I'll wait for my friends
Amen to anything that brings a quick return
To my friends, to my friends
music
Well, it means I was unfaithful
But for now I'll be more faithful
Never turn your back on mother earth
music
That was originally a single from the Sparks' fourth album,
Propaganda, released in 1974.
And back in our first show, we featured in the Sundown Sessions,
two tracks from that album, and if you check out the Listen Again feature,
you'll be able to hear them again.
But perhaps it's probably worth waiting until the show is finished
before I divert you off to somewhere else
and then you fall down a bit of a rabbit hole.
Anyway, that was Bill McKenzie from the album,
Transmission Impossible, 2005.
And last night I added to the Sundown Sessions show notes,
which haven't gone live just yet.
They'll go live at the end of this show at sundownsessions.co.uk.
I just want to fact check what I was going to say.
So there's a...up until last night,
I did think it was a bit of an urban myth,
the story about the taxi when Bill McKenzie was dropped from the record label.
Up to that point, he had an A&R man that was just 100% behind him.
And just dropping him would never ever be considered.
But the record executives pulled him into the office, the A&R man,
and just gave him the figures, and it was something...
I can't quite remember, but it was quoted for argument's sake.
It was like many millions of pounds to record this album,
and he's just selling 25,000 copies.
So the decision had to be made to drop him.
So he was taken out to a restaurant, and he was told the bad news.
And by all accounts, he actually took it under the circumstances
reasonably well, and he just had one ask of the company.
He just said, look, do you think, you know, with me finishing up,
do you think I could get a cab just on the company account?
And they were like, yeah, sure, so they were down in London.
Of course, Billy stayed in Dundee.
So he got a cab from London to Dundee,
so he certainly got the last laugh there.
And the show notes, I'll include that there's actually...
it goes into a lot more detail, the story behind that.
It really is quite amusing.
So I'll include that.
I'll also make a reference to the documentary.
I ended up staying up till crazy o'clock last night watching.
It's certainly worth a watch.
And along with that as well, if you enjoyed that particular track,
I'll put a link on to a performance live at Ronnie Scott's as well,
which was...there was certainly a lot more to Billy than Party Fears 2.
That is absolutely for sure.
And I waited patiently for you
As you do just what you choose to do
And I will be your Lord again tonight my dear
Yeah, I heard a funny thing
Somebody said to me
That you could be in love with almost anyone
You think people are the greatest ones
And I will be your Lord again tonight my dear
I will be your Lord again tonight my dear
Yeah, I heard a funny thing
Somebody said to me
That you could be in love with almost anyone
You think people are the greatest ones
And I will be your Lord again tonight my dear
Hey, I said it's alright
You know I won't forget
All the times I waited patiently for you
Now you do just what you choose to do
And I will be your Lord again tonight my dear

There were two related tracks played back to back there.
The first was Alone Again Orr.
That was written by Brian McLean
and originally appeared on the band Love
Love album Forever Changes back in 1967
and that version that you heard there this evening was The Damned
and I believe that was our final Top 40 hit to date.
It was released back in 1987.
Peaking at number 27 in the UK single charts
and that was followed by The Stable
Artists from The Same Stable and The Electric
The Electra record, goodness do you know
can't quite get my words out today
I need to kind of own this
I'm still giddy
I've got tickets for Paul McCartney today
and this just news just kind of landed
just on my way into the studio
kind of a little bit scatty
so please bear with me
ignore my mistakes and enjoy the music
anyway let's try again
so the second track that you heard there
was People Are Strange
that was originally recorded of course by The Doors
and it featured on the album Strange Days back in 1967
that version that you heard there was by Echo and The Bunny Men
I am not 100% sure
that may have been a double A side of Lips Like Sugar
I'm not quite sure
the version that we were listening to there
at the time I bought a 12 inch
Lips Like Sugar was definitely an A side
but that track was on the B side
along with Roller Coaster
anyway I thought that was worthy of playing tonight
while we were playing some cover versions
I'm sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
I call out once I wake up
from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I pull my pillow to my head
and spin right in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you
This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to do it
and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
and did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you
I think I love you
so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for
I think I love you
but it's not what life is made of
though it worries me to say
that I've never felt this way
I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I've got so much to think about
hey
I think I love you
so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for
I think I love you
so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for
but it's not what life is made of
though it worries me to say
that I've never felt this way
believe me
you really don't have to worry
I only want to make you happy
and if you say hey go away I will
but I think better still I better stay around
and love you till you think I have a kiss
let me ask you to your face
do you think you love me
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
Well I Think I Love You by The Voice of the Beehive released in 1991. That was
actually written as a debut single for the Patriot family in 1970. It's up in
the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks. Now as with all the Patriot family's
studio output, the singles featured musicians are sorted with iconic Los
Angeles based sessions players The Wrecking Crew and if you listen to the
Pop Museum, this group of musicians will not be new to you. However if you've
somehow managed to miss that, I have some information in the sundown
sessions show notes and just really for your information The Wrecking Crew, they
played for so many artists during their active years and they really were, they
were so prolific. They were basically studio musicians in the 60s and 70s and
they were behind the Beach Boys. I mean when the Beach Boys were out touring,
Brian Wilson was at home, he was in the studio you know working with these
musicians you know and they were playing the
instrumentation while the band were out on the road. But it wasn't just limited
to the Beach Boys, The Birds, The Monkeys, The Mamas and Papas, The Association,
Sonny and Cher, Simon and Garfunkel, Nancy and Samantha. I could go on and on and on
and on and on and on but I won't. I'll just leave some notes in the show notes
and actually there was a there was a film made about The Wrecking Crew and so
I'll include a link to information about where you can get your hands on that to
watch it and just even to whet your appetite I'll include the official
trailer for that and really if I haven't sold it to you, I encourage you to to
check out that link because that almost certainly will. So I made a, this is a
rather tenuous link, I did mention the Pop Museum just a few moments ago now
Andrew this morning did say that he was tuning in tonight so I don't know if
that was just a sound bite and he's or he's actually watching the football or
maybe he is listening. Anyway I dedicate this next song to him. Now this is
actually a cover version. Jimmy Jones wrote the original but for my money this
this is definitely the better version and so Jimmy Jones wrote if your broken
heart needs repaired I'm the man to see. Well I actually think Adele Shannon is the man you need to see.
Hey girls, gather round
Because of what I'm putting down
Baby, I'm your handyman
I'm not the kind to use a pencil on a rule
I'm handy with a love that I know full
I fix broken hearts, I know I really can
If your broken heart needs repaired
I'm the man to see
I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
They'll come running to me
She is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know I really can
If your broken heart needs repaired
I'm the man to see
I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
They'll come running to me
She is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know I really can
If your broken heart needs repaired
I'm the man to see
I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
They'll come running to me
She is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know I really can
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on

I'm Jordan Monroe, my home is in flight,
but I wanted to make a new start in my life.
I was ready to fly to the US of A when a certain wheel
I see would say, oh, no, no, no, Jordan Monroe,
oh, no, no, no, Jordan Monroe,
oh, no, no, no, Jordan Monroe,
oh, no, no, Jordan Monroe,
So one day we went for a walk down the Glen and I asked her all over again
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
There ain't a way that we stand here and fight
When our Saturday priorities have entered our lives
Never one in this cradle would lie
Till another seconds slow abide
Oh, no, no, no,
joy named unknown
Oh, no, no, no,
leave me right
I don't want to go to ride a horse
I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
Watch your moves, stay out of danger
I'm driving under the city lights
You've gone too far, I'm just a stranger
I'm gonna have to run tonight
And when the love is won, the love is me
Into the night she'll follow me
The love is fine, but my reaction
Wasn't our solution
Love is adventure
Believe in everything, it's not what it seems
I hear this warning
Whatever happened to the realest meaning?
Do not call, I will not answer
You're wasting time for both of us
Save your thoughts, your love comes after
Find someone else that you can trust
And when the love is won, the love is me
Into the night she follows me
The love is fine, but my reaction
Wasn't our solution
Love is adventure
Believe in everything, it's not what it seems
I hear this warning
Whatever happened to the realest meaning?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Love is won
Ooh, ooh, love is me
Love is won
And when the love is won, the love is me
Into the night she follows me
The love is fine, but my reaction
Wasn't our solution
And when the love is won, the love is me
Into the night she follows me
The love is fine, but my reaction
Wasn't our solution
And when the love is won, the love is me
It was a little bit hazy because I was in and out of bands at that time, during that time frame
So I can't remember if I put a notice up saying
Bass player looking for a band or they had put a notice up saying
Band looking for a bass player
Anyway, we eventually connected
And I met them in a pub just outside Kenneway
And we went
Do you know, it was the rehearsal space now
It was out in the back of beyond, I think it was up Kenneway
I mean, I was kind of lost, we were just taking up a farm track
And the irony of them being called blue on shock
Wasn't lost on me
So during the first rehearsal with them, the floor
Considering we've got a lot of electrical gear
The floor was absolutely sodden
I mean, it was a great place to rehearse, it was just like an old outhouse
Possibly on a farmland
But it was, like I say, it was absolutely sodden
And how we never got a shock is
To this day, a bit of a mystery
And when I'm ready
Gonna buy me a brand new Chevy
Cause I ain't ever
Gonna drive around real steady
Buy these wheels
A Scabri and me
Gonna travel the world
Giving up the years of time
And I ain't ever
Giving up the years of time
And each night you're here
To be strong
The elevator it carries me
Whereas I'm on the second floor
There's a message, hey, I know you well
I'm gonna sell an even score, yeah
And when I'm ready
Gonna buy me a brand new Chevy
Cause I ain't ever
Gonna drive around real steady
Buy these wheels
A Scabri and me
Gonna travel the world
Giving up the years of time
And each night you're here
To be strong
To be strong
I've seen how it's been
Everybody is living, living
I can't fix it, I can't cash it
Saying, no, it's much too late to even care
And when I'm ready
Gonna buy me a brand new Chevy
Cause I ain't ever
Gonna drive around real steady
Buy these wheels
A Scabri and me
Gonna travel the world
Giving up the years of time
And each night you're here
To be strong
To be strong
To be strong
Oh, yeah, to be strong
To be strong
Oh, it takes so long
Oh, it takes so long
To be strong
To be strong
To be strong
To be strong
To be strong
To be strong
Yeah
It was a particular favourite of mine
I always say the particular favourites, I guess
I'm playing music that I love, so
I'm gonna like them naturally
But this one has a special place in my heart
Because it's one that
I actually really enjoyed playing
Yeah, we'll see what you think
Yeah
Being close freely from your bed
The words that follow end up when
The choose between what's right or wrong
Our gentle breathing keeps us strong
Well, it's a side effect
To find there's no one there
You can praise the soldiers
As they fall on virgin love
Well, it's no game for fools
Always trying to act so cute
And why the fighter's never won
The anger cuts me like a blade
I promise broken's never paid
Look to the skies, you're not alone
A tender smile I'm coming for
Well, it's a side effect
To find there's no one there
You can praise the soldiers
As they fall on virgin love
Well, it's no game for fools
Always trying to act so cute
And why the fighter's never won
The anger cuts me like a blade
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
Oh, no, I can't wait
Ooh, yeah
Well, it's a side effect
To find there's no one there
You can praise the soldiers
As they fall on virgin love
Well, it's no game for fools
Always trying to act so cute
And why the fighter's never won
And why the fighter's never won

Shine boy, you're a coy boy,
and you know I'm homo sapien too.
I'm a cruiser, you're a loser,
me a user, homo sapien too.
Homo superior in my interior,
but from the skin out I'm homo sapien too.
And you're homo sapien too.
And I'm homo sapien like you,
and we're homo sapien too.
And the world's filled with age or a stage
where we act all our lives.
And the words in the script seem to fit,
except we have some surprise.
I just want this to last,
for my ginger is passed out of gone.
And if this is the case,
then I'll lose it last race from now on.
Homo superior in my interior,

And you're homo sapien too.
And I'm homo sapien like you,
and we're homo sapien too.
And I just hope and pray that the day of our love is at hand.
You and I, me and you,
we will be one from two understand.
And the world is so long that I hope
there's no peace strong enough.
For we are on our own,
and the only thing known is our love.

The way you talk I often wondered
if I heard the what somewhere someplace before
I got so nervous when I called and found
that lately you had gone and changed your name
But I've got something on my mind
I want you here, I want you now
You'd better explain
Who is it to you running right now?
Is it true they're calling you the Chessy Girl?
Who is it to you running right now?
Is it true they're calling you the Chessy Girl?
Your best friend never calls you up
but you don't mind cause lately
things are winding the same
Ain't that just strange how people always
seem to know your face but just
they know your mind
Well I don't care, there's no one there
that even turn around and say
get out of this place
I want you here, I want you now
You'd better explain
Last night I saw a shooting star
when morning comes she hides away
a real disguise
Who is it to you running right now?
Is it true they're calling you the Chessy Girl?
Who is it to you running right now?
Now there's a tool that'll callin' you the Jelsie girl
Now there's a tool that'll callin' you
Is it true you're hurting right now Is it true that's calling you the Jelsie girl?
Is it true you're hurting right now Is it true that's calling you the Jelsie girl?
Is it true you're hurting right now Is it true that's calling you the Jelsie girl?
Is it true you're running right now? Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl?
Is it true you're running right now? Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl?
I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
Is it true you're running right now? Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl?
I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
Is it true you're running right now? You got me caught up in the Chelsea Girl
I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
Is it true you're running right now? You got me caught up in the Chelsea Girl
I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
Simple Minds and a time when I certainly enjoyed them.
I kind of lost interest really after Once Upon a Time, but that particular track was lifted from Life in a Day back in 1979.
And the performance, I've included in the show notes, some down sessions on the website.
The performance of that on the Old Grey Whistle Test is electric. I mean it really is. It's quite something else.
So I really encourage you to check that if the opportunity arises.
Now, as good as that song is, I can tell you someone that doesn't want to go to Chelsea.
And all the girls that it's going to kick.
I don't want to go to Chelsea.
Once Named Gus, Once Named Alfie
I don't want to go to Chelsea
Oh no, there's no movement
Even though I seen the movie
I don't want to check the books
I don't want nobody else
I don't want to go to Chelsea
Photographs and fancy tricks
To get your kicks at 66
And thinks of all the lips that it licks
And all the girls that it's going to fix
She gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle
That there's no place to see a bottom that is good waddle
Dabble to a furnace when she's last year's model
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsa
I don't want to go to Chelsea
Oh no, there's no movement
Even though I seen the movie
I don't want to check the books
I don't want nobody else
I don't want to go to Chelsea
I don't want to go to Chelsea
Albert Taylor on the fucking trumpet
And he's done, he's done, he's shown me
In a chariot
He's been put down
But that much rock
Stanley up there
Albert Taylor, Albert Taylor
To the bitch
John Peele
I didn't want ya
Man with a son
Albert Taylor, Albert Taylor
Benny Dolwich
Bessie Wunderbaum
Sammy Richardson
Andy Walker
Albert Taylor, Albert Taylor
Albert Taylor, Albert Taylor
Albert Taylor
Right, thank you.
Yeah, affectionately known as Albert Tatlock
That was, of course, the skids and TV stars
You know, going back to the opening of the show
It took me a long time
For anybody that knows me, Stuart Adamson
Who's very much responsible for me picking up the guitar
Anyway, he was responsible for me putting down for a spell
Because he was only really trying to master some of the big country tracks
I come to appreciate how difficult the instrument is
But thankfully, I didn't have it down too long
Picked up the guitar and kind of persevered with it
That track was, it was actually
Well, that track that I just played
That was on a deluxe version of an album
That was re-released fairly recently
Scared to Dance, 1979
The version that I particularly preferred was on
It was on the B side of Into the Valley
And sadly, just through a moment of madness, if you like
I sold that record
Kind of something I regret
In fact, I've sold quite a lot of records
I'm in the process of buying them back at an inflated price
Lesson learned there
Anyway, that was the B side of Into the Valley
And it was a slightly different edit
Because it continued on at the end
And Stuart Adamson burst into
A rather ad hoc jam of Wild Mountain time
And it's just the style of his guitar
Of his playing rather
It's just something else
And there you go
Actually talking about it makes me a bit sad
It's a terrible waste
And he's a grossly, grossly underrated musician
Anyway, it seems quite fitting that the next track I play
Is a big country track
This is You Dreamer
Down at the corner store
Never busy anymore
He's in the backroom talking high
In there all by himself
Counting bucks up from the shelf
Watching the window fill with flies
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the way that you believed
Your life was gonna turn hell
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the better world
That you were making all those plans for
Meanwhile in the great indoors
Pizza boxes on the floor
Prescription junkies past the day
TV actors screw around
Wrapped in silk and dressing gowns
A grown-up drama for a day
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the way that you believed
Your life was gonna turn hell
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the better world
That you were making all those plans for
You know there's a house on Victory Street
Where no one wipes their feet
A car is rusting in the yard
Mommy's crops and daddy's scores
Kids have stashed beneath the floor
Under the bed of baby blue
I need a guidebook
I need a guidebook
Get me a map
Not even Indiana Jones could deal with that
The tank is empty
Oh, we'll game off
How can someone find me
If no one knows I'm lost
Hey, if no one knows I'm lost
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the way that you believed
Your life was gonna turn hell
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the better world
That you were making all those plans for
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the way that you believed
Your life was gonna turn hell
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the better world
That you were making all those plans for
You know there's a house on Victory Street
Where no one wipes their feet
A car is rusting in the yard
All those plans for
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the way that you believed
Your life was gonna turn hell
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the better world
That you were making all those plans for
Oh, you dreamer
Is this the way that you believed
Your life was gonna turn hell
It took me quite a while to actually play a big country record
For a long time
It just somehow affected me
It's not as if I knew him
But yeah, I met him once right enough
Kind of a bit of a funny story
My mum, this was back in the album
I can't quite remember
Steel Town may have been released the album
The second album, 94
Or it was maybe on the cusp
But certainly the lead single from it
East of Eden had been released
Because my mum had found out that
Stuart Adamson was making an appearance at Alan Duffa's Motorcycles in Lesley
They were interested in there because Stuart had a fascination with the motorbikes
And really everything going on in Knock Hill
So my mum took me up one Saturday morning
There I was, I had my East of Eden
East of Eden seven and single
And up rocked
I could see Sandra, that's his wife
Stuart and Callum, that was his son
They come in and I was
I mean I was just a teenager
And I was starstruck
So I went up to him
And you know, I did better
Actually in my defence, I did a bit better than ask him what his favourite colour was or something like that
Although marginally better, I must admit
I asked him if a band called White China were going to be supporting him
Or supporting them rather, not him
Supporting them at the Edinburgh Playhouse
It was a gig I was due to be going at shortly afterwards
And he said he wasn't sure
And for some context, I didn't quite appreciate this at the time
But White China were also a Dunfermline band
And Jamie Stewart happened to be Stuart Adamson's brother-in-law
He played guitar
And you know, I've just actually
Talking about them
I'm definitely going to feature on them
Because they're a band that should definitely have done something
And I've got quite a few interesting stories to tell you about them
Anyway, I digress slightly
So we were at Alan Duffer's
So he duly signed the autograph
And then I went away
Unbeknownst to me, it was really when I got my hands on the album
I thought, oh my goodness, I couldn't believe it
Bruce Watson was standing beside him, of course
I'd just seen photos of Bruce from the crossing
He had short hair and what have you
But he was going through some long hair phase
And you know, I didn't think he was recognisable
So I'm a little bit embarrassed about that
I could have had both a lot of gas
But there you go, I got the main man
And that's the point
Anyway, I'm talking about Sandra, his wife
And Callum, his son
It's probably worth mentioning his daughter, Kirsten
Kirsten Armstrong, a completely musical family
Kirsten's actually just finished a very successful tour of the Highlands and Islands
She's more into the Americana scene
Yeah, I'd say Americana, not contrary as such
And what I think is particularly interesting about Kirsten is
Like a lot of musicians during that dark time back in 2020
When, yeah, we'll just call it that dark time
When musicians were having to stay in locked doors
They opened their doors in quite innovative ways
So it was a good opportunity to see John Fogarty, for example
He opened his doors, he was playing
And just getting to see how they lived
Just the male brothers
And they were performing like acoustic sets
And some of them would open up a Patreon account
Just trying to be a bit creative and imaginative
Trying to generate different sources of income
Anyway, I stumbled across Kirsten
And I was instantly hooked because unsurprisingly
She did a fair share of covers of her dad's songs
But I've got to give credit where it's due
Her material is, you know, it's Americana, what can I say
Anyway, this song was actually released
Oh goodness, let me check my show notes here
I can't find it quickly to hand
But it was released probably a couple of years ago
And it's actually paying homage to her dad
This is Kirsten Armson and My Father's Songs
I would listen to my father
When he talked about the road
He'd say all you do is hurry up
And hang around some more
And I'd wait for him to call each night
Say he won't be long
But I never knew my father
Till I sang my father's songs
My mother always told me
That I sang before I could talk
She said life's a dance you have to learn
Don't run before you walk
So I spent my time toot singing along
Learning right from wrong
But I never knew my father
Till I sang my father's songs
The summer days were golden
On the road my dad and me
Loaded up on hopes and dreams
From Fife to Tennessee
I was searching for a place to land
Somewhere to belong
But I never knew my father
Till I sang my father's songs
And told me he'll be forever young
As I carry him in me
And my journey's just beginning
Now through his eyes I see
Now I'll sing to my father
With the wind howling through the trees
From heroes' tales to pain and truth
Sweet Celtic melodies
I don't have all the answers
And some things are best unknown
For I never knew my father
Till I sang my father's songs
I never knew my father
Till I sang my father's songs
No, I never knew my father
Till I sang my father's songs

At the coast, one call could save lives
Coast Guard
In an emergency call 999 and ask for the Coast Guard
I should thank you almost
No one could kill it off until you let it
But I got rid of that ghost
With certain habits to remain embedded
With the shadow of the doubt
But baby it was you who fed it
And I don't know what else to say
But I think you get it
I should have known
That it was coming down to this
I should have known
You would betray me but without the kill
I should have known
You kind of said that it is
And always isn't always
When you smudge your photograph
I've been keeping you
But you're still living those days
When I stay awake just to watch you sleeping
You didn't deliver that blow
But it left a mark on me that you're not seeing
And I don't know what else to hear
But it's not me weeping
I should have known
That it was coming down to this
I should have known
You would betray me but without the kill
I should have known
You kind of said that it is
I should have seen the cracks in the ceiling
And the mirror covered up with dust
But I was busy talking on the phone
I should have seen the obstacles
But I said this house was built for us
Hello
Is anybody home?
I should have known
The minute that we hit the wall
I should have known
That the writing was upon the star
I should have known
Cause Rome was starting to fall
I should have known
That was Amy Mann and I should have known
That was from the album Whatever
Released in 1993
I first actually come across Amy Mann
It was Jules Holland
I've continually made reference to the old great whistle test
And there's not really many programs that have followed that in my opinion
Jules Holland was, in my opinion of course, good for a spell
But it's maybe my age and it's more a reflection of how my taste has moved on
It maybe is still as good, I don't know
But I was going through a spell listening
Coming across quite an amazing amount of bands actually
And Amy Mann was one of them
And Amy Mann of course fronted a band called Till Tuesday
In the early 80s
And went on to, I was going to say bigger and better things
But she's had a fairly successful solo career
And she's collaborated with a lot of musicians
On that album Whatever
If my memory serves me correctly
It was John Bryan of course, he played the drums
Elvis Costello
And then the follow up to that album Whatever
I'm with Stupid
That's really where all the stars came out
Christopher, Glenn Tilbrook
And my goodness, you stick a microphone in front of me
This happened last week
I just draw a black
Anyway, Amy Mann I should have known
One other such band
That I stumbled across actually on Jules Holland
Was a band called The Unbelievable Truth
And they performed this song building
And don't adjust your headsets
Don't think there's anything wrong with the volume
The way this song starts off quite quiet
And builds up to quite a crescendo
The performance on Jules Holland
Was something else
I tried to source on YouTube
And I think due to copyright reasons
I don't know if it's the BBC that have pulled the plug on it
Or the record company
Or I don't know
Anyway, I can't for the life of me find that
Because I'd really like to share it
Because I was really, really taken
Taken with this performance
Anyway, we've got the next best thing
We've got the track building coming up
But before I do, I'd just like to
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that
The band have released for the first time actually
On streaming platforms
And it's available for download
Miscellaneous tracks
It'd be really incorrect to say
That we're on the cutting floor
Because they're anything but scraps
You know, they're worthy of an album
And their own writing, of course, that's what they are
Anyway, I really encourage you to check that out
And I will most definitely, because I have the information for that
I'll leave the links on the show notes
At the sundownsessions.co.uk
Thank you for tuning in
Listen to the dead
Say what you want
Say what you want
And did I choose
To be
The one who
Is left
Or is this something
That's been a stir
And is this proof
Against
My ignorance
Or am I
Meant to waste away
My ignorance
Or am I
Meant to waste away
My ignorance
Or am I
Meant to waste away
Complete the picture
With a girl who only
Listens to the dead
Praise to them
Please say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
To behave
This time
Trapped in a building
With the ghosts of
All the people
I betrayed
Say what you want
Say what you want
There's no reason
To step out
To a nation
That won't see me
Say what you want
Say what you want
And is this proof
Again
My ignorance
Or am I
Meant to waste away
Did I choose
To be
The one
Who has left
Or is this something
That's been a stir
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want
Now, as I fade out, I'm going to give you 8 seconds to find yourself a pair of headphones
so you can hear.
You can really, truly, truly appreciate this.
And if you don't have a pair of headphones, well, yeah, well, it's not too late.
Just turn that volume up to number 11.
Now, if you're a Visage fan or you have this album, you all know this, but chances are
you may not.
This is probably more of an obscure track, but it's every bit as good as the ones that
you're probably more familiar with.
So shrewd, black hat, cold eyes
Pointed foot, no heart, never cries
Hot sun, desert sand, one man
On his own, steps alone, never end
No ties, no claims, no name
Man of fancy, man of fortune, man of fame
No show, gotta go, Mexico
Every man wanna be mother, so
No
No
So shrewd, black hat, cold eyes
Pointed foot, no heart, never cries
Hot sun, desert sand, one man
On his own, steps alone, never end
No ties, no claims, no name
So shrewd, black hat, cold eyes
Here you go, that was Visage. From the album, Visage, released back in 1980, and that was
a track called Mild Pastel Man, and really it's got Madure's fingerprints all over that,
and you know Steve Strange, obviously, naturally, with him fronting the band. He was credible
a lot, but I do think Madure was instrumental in a lot of their work. In fact, really everything
he touches, it turns to gold. Anyway, sticking with the kind of new romantic theme, just
while that was playing, I had a text from Jane from Leith, so it's nice to know that
not everybody's watching the football tonight. Anyway, really enjoying the show, Colin. A
lot of favourites played tonight. Well, that's really good to hear. I do recall that you
sent a text, probably on my first show, first or second show. Well, only on my third show,
so it was one of those shows. And you actually gave me a list, it seems you have a lot of
favourites, Jane. Anyway, this one, this next one I've lined up especially for you, because
I know this is indeed one of your favourites, and it actually takes me back to a time when
I used to go to, I was at Disco, if my memory serves me correctly, I think it was at the
Locomotion Roadshow, a bit sketchy, but I remember it was in the Thornton Junction anyway,
and it was kind of a teeny boppers, it was maybe on a Monday night, and everybody, looking
back now, everybody was up thinking they were dancing like Jim Kerr, and in 14-year-old
eyes, I thought everybody who was doing it looked really cool. I do wonder what they
would think if I saw them now. Anyway, this is Simple Minds.

I actually have a special special guest who's going to be popping in. It's Kenny Armour from
Andy's Man Club and so our section about Geordie Munro. There's a section that I've called Geordie
Munro. We'll be talking about what Andy's Man Club is and how it's serving the Kirkcaldy area.
Until then, hopefully I'll see you next week. We're going to play out with the filthy tongues.
