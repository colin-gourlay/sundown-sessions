[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  Too many teardrops, for one heart to be crying Too many teardrops, for one heart to carry on
[00:23.000 --> 00:39.000]  You're way on top now, since you left me You're always laughing, way down at me
[00:39.000 --> 00:54.000]  But watch out now, I'm gonna get down And we'll be together for just a little while
[00:54.000 --> 01:11.000]  And then I'm gonna put you way down here And you'll start crying 96 tears
[01:11.000 --> 01:24.000]  Cry, you're gonna cry And when the sun comes up, I'll be on top
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.000]  You'll be right down there, looking up I'm gonna get to you, but I don't know
[01:32.000 --> 01:49.000]  You're gonna cry, 96 tears You're gonna cry, 96 tears
[01:49.000 --> 02:04.000]  You're gonna cry, 96 tears You're gonna cry, 96 tears
[02:04.000 --> 02:13.000]  Too many teardrops, all my love Too many teardrops
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.000]  Cry, cry, cry, cry now You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  96 tears All my love
[02:28.000 --> 02:44.000]  You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now 96 tears Cry, cry, cry now 96 tears Cry, cry, cry now 96 tears
[02:44.000 --> 02:53.000]  You're gonna cry, 96 tears You're gonna cry, 96 tears
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  Well, it was on my car on the way in
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  I was listening to one of her shows on the Listen Again feature
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  That you can find actually on the website
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  And I was actually, I fell off my seat
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  She was interviewing Slash and yes, it was that Slash
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  But that's not actually, I fell off my seat
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  I should add, I wasn't driving at this point
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  She was interviewing Tommy Paxton
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  Who's now vocals and guitar with Big Country
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  And I'll explain a little bit more why
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  Why that actually means an awful lot to me later on in the show
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  Anyway, back to my show
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  Again, yeah, sundown sessions
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  We kicked the show off with The Stranglers
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  And that was 96 tears
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  Originally recorded by Question Mark and The Mysterians
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  But this particular version that we listened to
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  Reached number 17 in the UK singles chart
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  And we're going to follow up with
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  Kind of following a little bit on a similar theme as last week
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  If you tuned in last week
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  We opened the show with a few cover versions
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  That I perhaps foolishly claimed that they were better than the originals
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  I'd still argue that Born to Run by Frankie Goes to Hollywood is better
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  But anyway, that's the beauty about music
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  It's all subjective
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  So I'm not going to make such a bold claim
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  I'm however going to play a few covers
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  And rather than me pass judgement on this particular one
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  I'm actually going to quote
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  I'm going to quote Trent Reznor
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Who actually wrote this song
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  And it appeared on the Nine Inch Nails second album
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  The Downward Spiral
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  Is of course the hurt that I'm referring to
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  And Reznor has been noticed
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  In praising Cash's interpretation of the song
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.000]  For its sincerity and meaning
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  Going on to say that the song just isn't his anymore
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  I mean, what better endorsement could you get?
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  This is Johnny Cash
[05:35.000 --> 05:41.000]  I focus on the pain
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  The only thing that's real
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000]  The needle tears the hole
[05:51.000 --> 05:56.000]  The old familiar sting
[05:56.000 --> 06:01.000]  Try to kill it all away
[06:01.000 --> 06:07.000]  But I remember everything
[06:07.000 --> 06:13.000]  What have I become
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  My sweetest friend
[06:18.000 --> 06:22.000]  Everyone I know
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  Goes away in the end
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  And you could have it all
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  My empire of dirt
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  I will let you down
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  I will make you hurt
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.000]  I wear this crown of thorns
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  Upon my liar's chair
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  Full of broken thoughts
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  I cannot repair
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  Beneath the stains of time
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.000]  The feelings disappear
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  You are someone else
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  I am still right here
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  What have I become
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  My sweetest friend
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  Everyone I know
[07:57.000 --> 08:03.000]  Goes away in the end
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  And you could have it all
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  My empire of dirt
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  I will let you down
[08:19.000 --> 08:24.000]  I will make you hurt
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  If I could start again
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  A million miles away
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  I would keep myself
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.000]  I would find a way
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  There's Johnny Cash and Hurt.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  When that was released back in 2002,
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  it was received with much commercial and critical acclaim.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  The related music video is considered by many to be
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  one of the greatest of all time by publications such as NME.
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  And I've got to, by way of a confession,
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  I wouldn't say even up to that point when I saw that,
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  I could actually take or leave Johnny Cash.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  Country music, as much as I was
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  going on at length about how I was open to all genres of music,
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  genres of music rather, last week,
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  country music never really seemed to grab me until
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  I went to Nashville a few years ago.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  And at the time I was heading out and we were doing the
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  what you really ought to do when you're out there.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  We went to Memphis, done Graceland, and it was more in my mind.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  When I came, when we went there, it felt like more of a holiday
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  and it was just like it was a bucket list thing that you have to do.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  But really by the time I came away from Nashville,
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  I just felt like it's a pilgrimage that anybody
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  that really cares for music,
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  you know, you should make a point of getting out there.
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  It's absolutely something else.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  The Grand Ole Opry up until I'd been there, I was like,
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  nah, it's not for me.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  But I was just absolutely blown away.
[10:15.000 --> 10:22.000]  And while I've not yet hit the floor on the line dancing scene,
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  I do have a particular soft spot for country music.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  And I thought I'd play that one because it's part of that trip.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  We went into the Johnny Cash Museum and after visiting it,
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  I was actually not surprised to learn that it was like
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  the number one music museum in the world
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  before it was in the National Geographic Traveler.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  It really is something else.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  And without really giving too much away, if you haven't been,
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  and I've somehow inspired you to go, that video,
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  that track actually plays quite a prominent part in that museum.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  And like I say, that turned me on to Johnny Cash
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  and country music.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  Anyway, while we're on the other side of the Atlantic
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  and still dealing with covers, I think if anybody ever, ever
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  does a decent job of the Mail Brothers and actually gets away,
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  in my opinion, gets away with the vocal of Russell Mail,
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  then you really need to sit up and pay attention.
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  This is Billy Mackenzie.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  music
[11:50.000 --> 11:56.000]  When she's on her best behaviour
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  Don't be tempted by her favours
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.000]  Never turn your back on mother earth
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  Tells her from May to be by hands
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  That looked so smooth to me
[12:22.000 --> 12:30.000]  She'll never turn your back on mother earth
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.000]  Crasped straws that toe across me
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  Gaze at clouds that come to cross
[12:42.000 --> 12:50.000]  She'll never turn your back on mother earth
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.000]  Three days and two nights I'll wait for my friends
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  Amen to anything that brings a quick return
[13:02.000 --> 13:12.000]  To my friends, to my friends
[13:22.000 --> 13:50.000]  music
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  Well, it means I was unfaithful
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.000]  But for now I'll be more faithful
[14:01.000 --> 14:17.000]  Never turn your back on mother earth
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  music
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  That was originally a single from the Sparks' fourth album,
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  Propaganda, released in 1974.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  And back in our first show, we featured in the Sundown Sessions,
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  two tracks from that album, and if you check out the Listen Again feature,
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  you'll be able to hear them again.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  But perhaps it's probably worth waiting until the show is finished
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  before I divert you off to somewhere else
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  and then you fall down a bit of a rabbit hole.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  Anyway, that was Bill McKenzie from the album,
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  Transmission Impossible, 2005.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  And last night I added to the Sundown Sessions show notes,
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  which haven't gone live just yet.
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  They'll go live at the end of this show at sundownsessions.co.uk.
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.000]  I just want to fact check what I was going to say.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  So there's a...up until last night,
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  I did think it was a bit of an urban myth,
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.000]  the story about the taxi when Bill McKenzie was dropped from the record label.
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.000]  Up to that point, he had an A&R man that was just 100% behind him.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  And just dropping him would never ever be considered.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  But the record executives pulled him into the office, the A&R man,
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  and just gave him the figures, and it was something...
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  I can't quite remember, but it was quoted for argument's sake.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  It was like many millions of pounds to record this album,
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  and he's just selling 25,000 copies.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  So the decision had to be made to drop him.
[15:56.000 --> 16:03.000]  So he was taken out to a restaurant, and he was told the bad news.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  And by all accounts, he actually took it under the circumstances
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  reasonably well, and he just had one ask of the company.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  He just said, look, do you think, you know, with me finishing up,
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  do you think I could get a cab just on the company account?
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  And they were like, yeah, sure, so they were down in London.
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  Of course, Billy stayed in Dundee.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  So he got a cab from London to Dundee,
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  so he certainly got the last laugh there.
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  And the show notes, I'll include that there's actually...
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  it goes into a lot more detail, the story behind that.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  It really is quite amusing.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  So I'll include that.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  I'll also make a reference to the documentary.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  I ended up staying up till crazy o'clock last night watching.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  It's certainly worth a watch.
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  And along with that as well, if you enjoyed that particular track,
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  I'll put a link on to a performance live at Ronnie Scott's as well,
[16:58.000 --> 17:04.000]  which was...there was certainly a lot more to Billy than Party Fears 2.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  That is absolutely for sure.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  And I waited patiently for you
[17:40.000 --> 17:46.000]  As you do just what you choose to do
[17:46.000 --> 17:53.000]  And I will be your Lord again tonight my dear
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  Yeah, I heard a funny thing
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.000]  Somebody said to me
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.000]  That you could be in love with almost anyone
[18:18.000 --> 18:25.000]  You think people are the greatest ones
[18:25.000 --> 18:31.000]  And I will be your Lord again tonight my dear
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  I will be your Lord again tonight my dear
[19:01.000 --> 19:06.000]  Yeah, I heard a funny thing
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.000]  Somebody said to me
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  That you could be in love with almost anyone
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.000]  You think people are the greatest ones
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.000]  And I will be your Lord again tonight my dear
[19:27.000 --> 19:42.000]  Hey, I said it's alright
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  You know I won't forget
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  All the times I waited patiently for you
[19:51.000 --> 19:57.000]  Now you do just what you choose to do
[19:57.000 --> 20:03.000]  And I will be your Lord again tonight my dear
[20:21.000 --> 20:46.000]  People are strange when you're a stranger
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  Faces look ugly when you're alone
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  Streets are under when you're down
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  When you're strange
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  Faces come out of the rain
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  When you're strange
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  No one remembers your name
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  When you're strange
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  When you're strange
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  People are strange when you're a stranger
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  Faces look ugly when you're alone
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
[21:30.000 --> 21:35.000]  Streets are uneven when you're down
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  When you're strange
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  Faces come out of the rain
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  When you're strange
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  No one remembers your name

[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  When you're unwanted, streets are uneven
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  When you're down, when you're strange
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  Faces come out of the rain
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  When you're strange
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  No one remembers your name
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  When you're strange
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  When you're strange
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  When you're strange
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  There were two related tracks played back to back there.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  The first was Alone Again Orr.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  That was written by Brian McLean
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  and originally appeared on the band Love
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  Love album Forever Changes back in 1967
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  and that version that you heard there this evening was The Damned
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  and I believe that was our final Top 40 hit to date.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  It was released back in 1987.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  Peaking at number 27 in the UK single charts
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  and that was followed by The Stable
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  Artists from The Same Stable and The Electric
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  The Electra record, goodness do you know
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  can't quite get my words out today
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.000]  I need to kind of own this
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  I'm still giddy
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  I've got tickets for Paul McCartney today
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  and this just news just kind of landed
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  just on my way into the studio
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  kind of a little bit scatty
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  so please bear with me
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  ignore my mistakes and enjoy the music
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  anyway let's try again
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  so the second track that you heard there
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  was People Are Strange
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  that was originally recorded of course by The Doors
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  and it featured on the album Strange Days back in 1967
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  that version that you heard there was by Echo and The Bunny Men
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  I am not 100% sure
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  that may have been a double A side of Lips Like Sugar
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  I'm not quite sure
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  the version that we were listening to there
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  at the time I bought a 12 inch
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  Lips Like Sugar was definitely an A side
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  but that track was on the B side
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  along with Roller Coaster
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  anyway I thought that was worthy of playing tonight
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  while we were playing some cover versions
[26:09.000 --> 26:26.000]  I'm sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  I call out once I wake up
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  from something that keeps knocking at my brain
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  Before I go insane I pull my pillow to my head
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  and spin right in my bed screaming out the words I dread
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  I think I love you
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  This morning I woke up with this feeling
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  I didn't know how to do it
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  and so I just decided to myself
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  and did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  I think I love you
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  I think I love you
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  so what am I so afraid of
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  a love there is no cure for
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  I think I love you
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  but it's not what life is made of
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  though it worries me to say
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  that I've never felt this way
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  I don't know what I'm up against
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  I don't know what it's all about
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  I've got so much to think about
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  hey
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  I think I love you
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  so what am I so afraid of
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  a love there is no cure for
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  I think I love you
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  so what am I so afraid of
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  a love there is no cure for
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  but it's not what life is made of
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  though it worries me to say
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  that I've never felt this way
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  believe me
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  you really don't have to worry
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  I only want to make you happy
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  and if you say hey go away I will
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  but I think better still I better stay around
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  and love you till you think I have a kiss
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  let me ask you to your face
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  do you think you love me
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  I think I love you
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  I think I love you
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  I think I love you
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.000]  I think I love you
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.000]  I think I love you
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  I think I love you
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.640]  Well I Think I Love You by The Voice of the Beehive released in 1991. That was
[29:05.640 --> 29:10.440]  actually written as a debut single for the Patriot family in 1970. It's up in
[29:10.440 --> 29:15.520]  the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks. Now as with all the Patriot family's
[29:15.520 --> 29:19.320]  studio output, the singles featured musicians are sorted with iconic Los
[29:19.320 --> 29:23.400]  Angeles based sessions players The Wrecking Crew and if you listen to the
[29:23.400 --> 29:31.600]  Pop Museum, this group of musicians will not be new to you. However if you've
[29:31.600 --> 29:36.440]  somehow managed to miss that, I have some information in the sundown
[29:36.440 --> 29:40.600]  sessions show notes and just really for your information The Wrecking Crew, they
[29:40.600 --> 29:45.240]  played for so many artists during their active years and they really were, they
[29:45.240 --> 29:50.680]  were so prolific. They were basically studio musicians in the 60s and 70s and
[29:50.720 --> 29:54.040]  they were behind the Beach Boys. I mean when the Beach Boys were out touring,
[29:54.040 --> 30:01.720]  Brian Wilson was at home, he was in the studio you know working with these
[30:01.720 --> 30:05.880]  musicians you know and they were playing the
[30:05.880 --> 30:11.880]  instrumentation while the band were out on the road. But it wasn't just limited
[30:11.880 --> 30:16.400]  to the Beach Boys, The Birds, The Monkeys, The Mamas and Papas, The Association,
[30:16.440 --> 30:21.880]  Sonny and Cher, Simon and Garfunkel, Nancy and Samantha. I could go on and on and on
[30:21.880 --> 30:26.160]  and on and on and on but I won't. I'll just leave some notes in the show notes
[30:26.160 --> 30:33.520]  and actually there was a there was a film made about The Wrecking Crew and so
[30:33.520 --> 30:39.120]  I'll include a link to information about where you can get your hands on that to
[30:39.120 --> 30:43.160]  watch it and just even to whet your appetite I'll include the official
[30:43.200 --> 30:47.840]  trailer for that and really if I haven't sold it to you, I encourage you to to
[30:47.840 --> 30:55.320]  check out that link because that almost certainly will. So I made a, this is a
[30:55.320 --> 31:01.800]  rather tenuous link, I did mention the Pop Museum just a few moments ago now
[31:01.800 --> 31:08.280]  Andrew this morning did say that he was tuning in tonight so I don't know if
[31:08.280 --> 31:11.640]  that was just a sound bite and he's or he's actually watching the football or
[31:11.680 --> 31:18.440]  maybe he is listening. Anyway I dedicate this next song to him. Now this is
[31:18.440 --> 31:23.640]  actually a cover version. Jimmy Jones wrote the original but for my money this
[31:23.640 --> 31:28.280]  this is definitely the better version and so Jimmy Jones wrote if your broken
[31:28.280 --> 31:33.480]  heart needs repaired I'm the man to see. Well I actually think Adele Shannon is the man you need to see.
[31:42.480 --> 31:45.480]  Hey girls, gather round
[31:45.480 --> 31:48.480]  Because of what I'm putting down
[31:49.480 --> 31:53.480]  Baby, I'm your handyman
[31:55.480 --> 31:58.480]  I'm not the kind to use a pencil on a rule
[31:58.480 --> 32:01.480]  I'm handy with a love that I know full
[32:01.480 --> 32:06.480]  I fix broken hearts, I know I really can
[32:07.320 --> 32:11.320]  If your broken heart needs repaired

[32:14.320 --> 32:17.320]  I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
[32:17.320 --> 32:20.320]  They'll come running to me
[32:20.320 --> 32:24.320]  She is the main thing I want to say

[32:27.320 --> 32:32.320]  I fix broken hearts, I know I really can

[32:43.320 --> 32:46.320]  I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
[32:46.320 --> 32:49.320]  They'll come running to me
[32:49.320 --> 32:52.320]  She is the main thing I want to say
[32:52.320 --> 32:55.320]  I'm busy 24 hours a day
[32:55.320 --> 32:58.320]  I fix broken hearts, I know I really can
[33:00.320 --> 33:03.320]  If your broken heart needs repaired
[33:04.160 --> 33:07.160]  I'm the man to see
[33:07.160 --> 33:10.160]  I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
[33:10.160 --> 33:13.160]  They'll come running to me

[33:17.160 --> 33:20.160]  I'm busy 24 hours a day
[33:20.160 --> 33:25.160]  I fix broken hearts, I know I really can

[34:16.560 --> 34:18.480]  If I'm going out on my new paddleboard,
[34:18.480 --> 34:20.800]  the last thing I'm taking is my phone, right?
[34:20.800 --> 34:23.360]  Buoyancy aid, fine, but mobile?
[34:23.360 --> 34:24.720]  My whole life's on that phone.
[34:24.720 --> 34:26.080]  Why would I risk losing it in the...
[34:27.080 --> 34:28.800]  Coast Guard, help!
[34:28.800 --> 34:30.520]  OK, help's on its way.
[34:31.520 --> 34:32.880]  Grab my hand!
[34:34.760 --> 34:37.520]  Phone in a waterproof pouch.
[34:37.520 --> 34:40.160]  It's the first thing I pack now.
[34:40.160 --> 34:42.800]  In an emergency at the coast, call 999
[34:42.800 --> 34:44.240]  and ask for the Coast Guard,
[34:44.240 --> 34:46.400]  and please respect the water.
[34:56.080 --> 34:59.720]  I'm Jordan Monroe, my home is in flight,
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.440]  but I wanted to make a new start in my life.
[35:03.440 --> 35:08.920]  I was ready to fly to the US of A when a certain wheel
[35:08.920 --> 35:17.840]  I see would say, oh, no, no, no, Jordan Monroe,
[35:17.840 --> 35:26.000]  oh, no, no, no, Jordan Monroe,
[35:26.000 --> 35:34.560]  oh, no, no, no, Jordan Monroe,
[35:34.560 --> 35:43.720]  oh, no, no, Jordan Monroe,
[35:43.720 --> 36:06.720]  So one day we went for a walk down the Glen and I asked her all over again
[36:06.720 --> 36:36.720]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[36:36.720 --> 36:39.740]  There ain't a way that we stand here and fight
[36:39.900 --> 36:43.340]  When our Saturday priorities have entered our lives
[36:43.500 --> 36:46.980]  Never one in this cradle would lie
[36:47.140 --> 36:50.560]  Till another seconds slow abide
[36:50.720 --> 36:54.820]  Oh, no, no, no,
[36:54.980 --> 36:58.180]  joy named unknown
[36:58.320 --> 37:01.180]  Oh, no, no, no,
[37:01.320 --> 37:04.300]  leave me right
[37:04.300 --> 37:11.300]  I don't want to go to ride a horse
[37:11.300 --> 37:18.300]  I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
[37:18.300 --> 37:27.300]  I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
[37:34.300 --> 37:44.300]  I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
[38:04.300 --> 38:14.300]  I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
[38:34.300 --> 38:44.300]  I'd rather stay here in Kirkcaldy
[39:04.300 --> 39:14.300]  Watch your moves, stay out of danger
[39:14.300 --> 39:17.300]  I'm driving under the city lights
[39:17.300 --> 39:21.300]  You've gone too far, I'm just a stranger
[39:21.300 --> 39:24.300]  I'm gonna have to run tonight
[39:24.300 --> 39:27.300]  And when the love is won, the love is me
[39:27.300 --> 39:30.300]  Into the night she'll follow me
[39:30.300 --> 39:34.300]  The love is fine, but my reaction
[39:34.300 --> 39:38.300]  Wasn't our solution
[39:38.300 --> 39:41.300]  Love is adventure
[39:41.300 --> 39:48.300]  Believe in everything, it's not what it seems
[39:48.300 --> 39:51.300]  I hear this warning
[39:51.300 --> 39:57.300]  Whatever happened to the realest meaning?
[40:01.300 --> 40:10.300]  Do not call, I will not answer
[40:10.300 --> 40:13.300]  You're wasting time for both of us
[40:13.300 --> 40:17.300]  Save your thoughts, your love comes after
[40:17.300 --> 40:20.300]  Find someone else that you can trust
[40:20.300 --> 40:23.300]  And when the love is won, the love is me
[40:23.300 --> 40:26.300]  Into the night she follows me
[40:26.300 --> 40:30.300]  The love is fine, but my reaction
[40:30.300 --> 40:34.300]  Wasn't our solution
[40:34.300 --> 40:37.300]  Love is adventure
[40:37.300 --> 40:44.300]  Believe in everything, it's not what it seems
[40:44.300 --> 40:47.300]  I hear this warning
[40:47.300 --> 40:53.300]  Whatever happened to the realest meaning?
[40:56.300 --> 40:59.300]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[41:10.300 --> 41:13.300]  Love is won
[41:16.300 --> 41:19.300]  Ooh, ooh, love is me
[41:19.300 --> 41:21.300]  Love is won
[41:28.300 --> 41:32.300]  And when the love is won, the love is me
[41:32.300 --> 41:35.300]  Into the night she follows me
[41:35.300 --> 41:39.300]  The love is fine, but my reaction
[41:39.300 --> 41:42.300]  Wasn't our solution
[41:42.300 --> 41:45.300]  And when the love is won, the love is me
[41:45.300 --> 41:48.300]  Into the night she follows me
[41:48.300 --> 41:51.300]  The love is fine, but my reaction
[41:51.300 --> 41:54.300]  Wasn't our solution
[41:54.300 --> 41:57.300]  And when the love is won, the love is me
[42:18.300 --> 42:22.300]  It was a little bit hazy because I was in and out of bands at that time, during that time frame
[42:22.300 --> 42:25.300]  So I can't remember if I put a notice up saying
[42:25.300 --> 42:28.300]  Bass player looking for a band or they had put a notice up saying
[42:28.300 --> 42:31.300]  Band looking for a bass player
[42:31.300 --> 42:34.300]  Anyway, we eventually connected
[42:34.300 --> 42:37.300]  And I met them in a pub just outside Kenneway
[42:37.300 --> 42:40.300]  And we went
[42:40.300 --> 42:43.300]  Do you know, it was the rehearsal space now
[42:43.300 --> 42:46.300]  It was out in the back of beyond, I think it was up Kenneway
[42:46.300 --> 42:49.300]  I mean, I was kind of lost, we were just taking up a farm track
[42:49.300 --> 42:52.300]  And the irony of them being called blue on shock
[42:52.300 --> 42:55.300]  Wasn't lost on me
[42:55.300 --> 42:58.300]  So during the first rehearsal with them, the floor
[42:58.300 --> 43:01.300]  Considering we've got a lot of electrical gear
[43:01.300 --> 43:04.300]  The floor was absolutely sodden
[43:04.300 --> 43:07.300]  I mean, it was a great place to rehearse, it was just like an old outhouse
[43:07.300 --> 43:10.300]  Possibly on a farmland
[43:10.300 --> 43:13.300]  But it was, like I say, it was absolutely sodden
[43:13.300 --> 43:16.300]  And how we never got a shock is
[43:16.300 --> 43:19.300]  To this day, a bit of a mystery
[43:43.300 --> 43:46.300]  And when I'm ready
[43:46.300 --> 43:49.300]  Gonna buy me a brand new Chevy
[43:49.300 --> 43:52.300]  Cause I ain't ever
[43:52.300 --> 43:55.300]  Gonna drive around real steady
[43:55.300 --> 43:58.300]  Buy these wheels
[43:58.300 --> 44:01.300]  A Scabri and me
[44:01.300 --> 44:04.300]  Gonna travel the world
[44:04.300 --> 44:07.300]  Giving up the years of time
[44:07.300 --> 44:10.300]  And I ain't ever
[44:10.300 --> 44:13.300]  Giving up the years of time
[44:13.300 --> 44:16.300]  And each night you're here
[44:16.300 --> 44:19.300]  To be strong
[44:19.300 --> 44:22.300]  The elevator it carries me
[44:22.300 --> 44:25.300]  Whereas I'm on the second floor
[44:25.300 --> 44:28.300]  There's a message, hey, I know you well
[44:28.300 --> 44:31.300]  I'm gonna sell an even score, yeah
[44:34.300 --> 44:37.300]  And when I'm ready
[44:37.300 --> 44:40.300]  Gonna buy me a brand new Chevy
[44:40.300 --> 44:43.300]  Cause I ain't ever
[44:43.300 --> 44:46.300]  Gonna drive around real steady
[44:46.300 --> 44:49.300]  Buy these wheels
[44:49.300 --> 44:52.300]  A Scabri and me
[44:52.300 --> 44:55.300]  Gonna travel the world
[44:55.300 --> 44:58.300]  Giving up the years of time
[44:58.300 --> 45:01.300]  And each night you're here
[45:01.300 --> 45:04.300]  To be strong
[45:04.300 --> 45:07.300]  To be strong
[45:10.300 --> 45:13.300]  I've seen how it's been
[45:13.300 --> 45:16.300]  Everybody is living, living
[45:16.300 --> 45:19.300]  I can't fix it, I can't cash it
[45:19.300 --> 45:24.300]  Saying, no, it's much too late to even care
[45:24.300 --> 45:27.300]  And when I'm ready
[45:27.300 --> 45:30.300]  Gonna buy me a brand new Chevy
[45:30.300 --> 45:33.300]  Cause I ain't ever
[45:33.300 --> 45:37.300]  Gonna drive around real steady
[45:37.300 --> 45:40.300]  Buy these wheels
[45:40.300 --> 45:43.300]  A Scabri and me
[45:43.300 --> 45:46.300]  Gonna travel the world
[45:46.300 --> 45:49.300]  Giving up the years of time
[45:49.300 --> 45:52.300]  And each night you're here
[45:52.300 --> 45:55.300]  To be strong
[45:57.300 --> 46:00.300]  To be strong
[46:03.300 --> 46:06.300]  To be strong
[46:10.300 --> 46:13.300]  Oh, yeah, to be strong
[46:18.300 --> 46:20.300]  To be strong
[46:20.300 --> 46:23.300]  Oh, it takes so long
[46:33.300 --> 46:36.300]  Oh, it takes so long
[46:36.300 --> 46:39.300]  To be strong
[46:39.300 --> 46:42.300]  To be strong
[46:42.300 --> 46:45.300]  To be strong
[46:45.300 --> 46:48.300]  To be strong
[46:48.300 --> 46:51.300]  To be strong
[46:51.300 --> 46:54.300]  To be strong
[46:54.300 --> 46:57.300]  Yeah
[47:03.300 --> 47:06.300]  It was a particular favourite of mine
[47:06.300 --> 47:08.300]  I always say the particular favourites, I guess
[47:08.300 --> 47:10.300]  I'm playing music that I love, so
[47:10.300 --> 47:12.300]  I'm gonna like them naturally
[47:12.300 --> 47:15.300]  But this one has a special place in my heart
[47:15.300 --> 47:18.300]  Because it's one that
[47:18.300 --> 47:21.300]  I actually really enjoyed playing
[47:21.300 --> 47:23.300]  Yeah, we'll see what you think
[47:33.300 --> 47:36.300]  Yeah
[48:04.300 --> 48:08.300]  Being close freely from your bed
[48:12.300 --> 48:16.300]  The words that follow end up when
[48:19.300 --> 48:23.300]  The choose between what's right or wrong
[48:27.300 --> 48:31.300]  Our gentle breathing keeps us strong
[48:34.300 --> 48:37.300]  Well, it's a side effect
[48:37.300 --> 48:41.300]  To find there's no one there
[48:42.300 --> 48:44.300]  You can praise the soldiers
[48:44.300 --> 48:48.300]  As they fall on virgin love
[48:49.300 --> 48:52.300]  Well, it's no game for fools
[48:52.300 --> 48:56.300]  Always trying to act so cute
[48:57.300 --> 49:01.300]  And why the fighter's never won
[49:04.300 --> 49:08.300]  The anger cuts me like a blade
[49:12.300 --> 49:16.300]  I promise broken's never paid
[49:19.300 --> 49:23.300]  Look to the skies, you're not alone
[49:27.300 --> 49:31.300]  A tender smile I'm coming for
[49:34.300 --> 49:37.300]  Well, it's a side effect
[49:37.300 --> 49:41.300]  To find there's no one there
[49:42.300 --> 49:44.300]  You can praise the soldiers
[49:44.300 --> 49:48.300]  As they fall on virgin love
[49:49.300 --> 49:52.300]  Well, it's no game for fools
[49:52.300 --> 49:56.300]  Always trying to act so cute
[49:57.300 --> 50:01.300]  And why the fighter's never won
[50:03.300 --> 50:07.300]  The anger cuts me like a blade
[50:10.300 --> 50:12.300]  I can't wait
[50:14.300 --> 50:16.300]  I can't wait
[50:18.300 --> 50:20.300]  I can't wait
[50:21.300 --> 50:23.300]  I can't wait
[50:25.300 --> 50:27.300]  I can't wait
[50:27.300 --> 50:30.300]  Oh, no, I can't wait
[50:30.300 --> 50:32.300]  Ooh, yeah
[50:32.300 --> 50:35.300]  Well, it's a side effect
[50:35.300 --> 50:39.300]  To find there's no one there
[50:40.300 --> 50:42.300]  You can praise the soldiers
[50:42.300 --> 50:46.300]  As they fall on virgin love
[50:47.300 --> 50:50.300]  Well, it's no game for fools
[50:50.300 --> 50:54.300]  Always trying to act so cute
[50:55.300 --> 50:59.300]  And why the fighter's never won
[51:00.300 --> 51:06.300]  And why the fighter's never won
[51:30.300 --> 51:35.300]  When it comes to selling your home, no one knows the local market better than Fife Properties.

[53:47.300 --> 53:50.300]  Shine boy, you're a coy boy,
[53:50.300 --> 53:54.300]  and you know I'm homo sapien too.
[53:54.300 --> 53:57.300]  I'm a cruiser, you're a loser,
[53:57.300 --> 54:01.300]  me a user, homo sapien too.
[54:04.300 --> 54:08.300]  Homo superior in my interior,
[54:08.300 --> 54:12.300]  but from the skin out I'm homo sapien too.
[54:12.300 --> 54:16.300]  And you're homo sapien too.
[54:16.300 --> 54:19.300]  And I'm homo sapien like you,
[54:19.300 --> 54:23.300]  and we're homo sapien too.
[54:25.300 --> 54:28.300]  And the world's filled with age or a stage
[54:28.300 --> 54:31.300]  where we act all our lives.
[54:32.300 --> 54:35.300]  And the words in the script seem to fit,
[54:35.300 --> 54:38.300]  except we have some surprise.
[54:39.300 --> 54:41.300]  I just want this to last,
[54:41.300 --> 54:45.300]  for my ginger is passed out of gone.
[54:46.300 --> 54:48.300]  And if this is the case,
[54:48.300 --> 54:51.300]  then I'll lose it last race from now on.
[55:12.300 --> 55:16.300]  Homo superior in my interior,
[55:16.300 --> 55:20.300]  but from the skin out I'm homo sapien too.
[55:20.300 --> 55:24.300]  And you're homo sapien too.
[55:24.300 --> 55:28.300]  And I'm homo sapien like you,
[55:28.300 --> 55:32.300]  and we're homo sapien too.
[55:33.300 --> 55:38.300]  And I just hope and pray that the day of our love is at hand.
[55:39.300 --> 55:42.300]  You and I, me and you,
[55:42.300 --> 55:45.300]  we will be one from two understand.
[55:47.300 --> 55:50.300]  And the world is so long that I hope
[55:50.300 --> 55:54.300]  there's no peace strong enough.
[55:55.300 --> 55:57.300]  For we are on our own,
[55:57.300 --> 56:00.300]  and the only thing known is our love.
[56:02.300 --> 56:04.300]  I don't want to classify you
[56:04.300 --> 56:07.300]  like an animal in the zoo.
[56:09.300 --> 56:11.300]  But it seems good to me
[56:11.300 --> 56:15.300]  to know that you're homo sapien too.
[56:18.300 --> 56:20.300]  I'm the shadow god,
[56:20.300 --> 56:23.300]  you're the card god.
[56:24.300 --> 56:26.300]  I don't want to classify you
[56:26.300 --> 56:29.300]  like an animal in the zoo.
[56:29.300 --> 56:31.300]  But it seems good to me
[56:31.300 --> 56:35.300]  to know that you're homo sapien too.
[56:39.300 --> 56:41.300]  I don't want to classify you
[56:41.300 --> 56:45.300]  like an animal in the zoo.
[56:45.300 --> 56:47.300]  But it seems good to me
[56:47.300 --> 56:53.300]  to know that you're homo sapien too.
[56:53.300 --> 56:55.300]  I don't want to classify you
[56:55.300 --> 56:58.300]  like an animal in the zoo.
[57:39.300 --> 57:43.300]  Time flies, time pours,
[57:43.300 --> 57:47.300]  like a lens up and down the hall.
[57:47.300 --> 57:51.300]  The light was out.
[57:51.300 --> 57:53.300]  From the Sky News Centre at 9.
[57:53.300 --> 57:55.300]  A YouGov poll is predicting
[57:55.300 --> 57:57.300]  a 200-seat labour majority government
[57:57.300 --> 57:59.300]  at the general election,
[57:59.300 --> 58:01.300]  while the Tories could suffer
[58:01.300 --> 58:04.300]  their worst defeat in the general election.
[58:05.300 --> 58:07.300]  It projects gains for the Lib Dems,
[58:07.300 --> 58:09.300]  Greens Reform and Plaid Cymru,
[58:09.300 --> 58:11.300]  though the SNP could drop 28 seats.
[58:11.300 --> 58:14.300]  Leader John Swinney's launched their manifesto today
[58:14.300 --> 58:16.300]  with a push for further NHS funding
[58:16.300 --> 58:18.300]  with a central theme.
[58:18.300 --> 58:20.300]  Independence for the powers
[58:20.300 --> 58:22.300]  to protect our national health service
[58:22.300 --> 58:24.300]  and to help people through tough times.
[58:24.300 --> 58:26.300]  Independence for a stronger economy
[58:26.300 --> 58:28.300]  and happier, healthier lives.
[58:28.300 --> 58:31.300]  And independence for a better future.
[58:32.300 --> 58:34.300]  A close protection officer for Rishi Sunak
[58:34.300 --> 58:36.300]  has been arrested over alleged bets
[58:36.300 --> 58:38.300]  made about the timing of the election,
[58:38.300 --> 58:40.300]  with one understood to be worth
[58:40.300 --> 58:42.300]  at least three figures.
[58:42.300 --> 58:44.300]  A police constable has been bailed
[58:44.300 --> 58:46.300]  pending further inquiries.
[58:46.300 --> 58:48.300]  A seven-month-old baby has died
[58:48.300 --> 58:50.300]  after being attacked by a dog
[58:50.300 --> 58:52.300]  in Coventry on Sunday.
[58:52.300 --> 58:54.300]  Police say the animal isn't classed
[58:54.300 --> 58:56.300]  as a dangerous breed
[58:56.300 --> 58:58.300]  and has now been put down.
[58:58.300 --> 59:00.300]  More than 800 suspected migrants
[59:00.300 --> 59:02.300]  crossed the English Channel in small boats
[59:02.300 --> 59:04.300]  in a single day yesterday.
[59:04.300 --> 59:06.300]  Home Office figures show the number
[59:06.300 --> 59:08.300]  tops this year's record so far of 711
[59:08.300 --> 59:10.300]  and is the highest daily total
[59:10.300 --> 59:12.300]  since November 2022,
[59:12.300 --> 59:14.300]  when 947 people arrived.
[59:14.300 --> 59:18.300]  Scotland are hoping to get their Euro 2024 campaign
[59:18.300 --> 59:20.300]  back on track in a crucial game
[59:20.300 --> 59:22.300]  against Switzerland,
[59:22.300 --> 59:24.300]  now live to Joe Rawson
[59:24.300 --> 59:26.300]  at a fan park in Frankfurt.
[59:26.300 --> 59:28.300]  It's been much better from Scotland
[59:28.300 --> 59:30.300]  and they could even be in front.
[59:30.300 --> 59:32.300]  They took the lead to a great roar
[59:32.300 --> 59:34.300]  here in the fan park.
[59:34.300 --> 59:36.300]  Scott McTominay has deflected a goal
[59:36.300 --> 59:38.300]  in the 13th minute.
[59:38.300 --> 59:40.300]  Jehan Shakiri equalised with a beautiful finish
[59:40.300 --> 59:42.300]  after a mistake from Anthony Ralston.
[59:42.300 --> 59:44.300]  Must not lose, remember this one
[59:44.300 --> 59:46.300]  for Steve Clark's side over in Cologne.
[59:46.300 --> 59:48.300]  It's Scotland one, Switzerland one.
[59:48.300 --> 59:50.300]  And a lawyer for Justin Timberlake
[59:50.300 --> 59:52.300]  says he's looking forward to vigorously
[59:52.300 --> 59:54.300]  defending the singer's drink driving allegations.
[59:54.300 --> 59:56.300]  He was arrested yesterday in New York.
[59:56.300 --> 59:58.300]  That's the latest. I'm Stevie Schilling.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.300]  The way you talk I often wondered
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:33.300]  if I heard the what somewhere someplace before
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.300]  I got so nervous when I called and found
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:42.300]  that lately you had gone and changed your name
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.300]  But I've got something on my mind
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.300]  I want you here, I want you now
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.300]  You'd better explain
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.300]  Who is it to you running right now?
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.300]  Is it true they're calling you the Chessy Girl?
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:04.300]  Who is it to you running right now?
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:08.300]  Is it true they're calling you the Chessy Girl?
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.300]  Your best friend never calls you up
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.300]  but you don't mind cause lately
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:29.300]  things are winding the same
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.300]  Ain't that just strange how people always
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.300]  seem to know your face but just
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.300]  they know your mind
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.300]  Well I don't care, there's no one there
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.300]  that even turn around and say
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.300]  get out of this place
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:48.300]  I want you here, I want you now
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.300]  You'd better explain
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.300]  Last night I saw a shooting star
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.300]  when morning comes she hides away
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:03.300]  a real disguise
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.300]  Who is it to you running right now?
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:09.300]  Is it true they're calling you the Chessy Girl?
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.300]  Who is it to you running right now?
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.300]  Now there's a tool that'll callin' you the Jelsie girl
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:49.300]  Now there's a tool that'll callin' you
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:22.300]  Is it true you're hurting right now Is it true that's calling you the Jelsie girl?
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:31.300]  Is it true you're hurting right now Is it true that's calling you the Jelsie girl?
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:40.300]  Is it true you're hurting right now Is it true that's calling you the Jelsie girl?
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:48.300]  Is it true you're running right now? Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl?
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:56.300]  Is it true you're running right now? Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl?
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.300]  I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:05.300]  Is it true you're running right now? Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl?
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:08.300]  I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:14.300]  Is it true you're running right now? You got me caught up in the Chelsea Girl
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.300]  I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:23.300]  Is it true you're running right now? You got me caught up in the Chelsea Girl
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.300]  I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:32.300]  Simple Minds and a time when I certainly enjoyed them.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:42.300]  I kind of lost interest really after Once Upon a Time, but that particular track was lifted from Life in a Day back in 1979.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:47.300]  And the performance, I've included in the show notes, some down sessions on the website.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:54.300]  The performance of that on the Old Grey Whistle Test is electric. I mean it really is. It's quite something else.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:59.300]  So I really encourage you to check that if the opportunity arises.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:03.300]  Now, as good as that song is, I can tell you someone that doesn't want to go to Chelsea.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.300]  And all the girls that it's going to kick.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:02.300]  I don't want to go to Chelsea.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:34.300]  Once Named Gus, Once Named Alfie
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.300]  I don't want to go to Chelsea
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.300]  Oh no, there's no movement
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.300]  Even though I seen the movie
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:45.300]  I don't want to check the books
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.300]  I don't want nobody else
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.300]  I don't want to go to Chelsea
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:04.300]  Photographs and fancy tricks
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.300]  To get your kicks at 66
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:10.300]  And thinks of all the lips that it licks
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.300]  And all the girls that it's going to fix
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.300]  She gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:19.300]  That there's no place to see a bottom that is good waddle
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.300]  Dabble to a furnace when she's last year's model
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.300]  They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsa
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.300]  I don't want to go to Chelsea
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:31.300]  Oh no, there's no movement
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.300]  Even though I seen the movie
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.300]  I don't want to check the books
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:40.300]  I don't want nobody else
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.300]  I don't want to go to Chelsea
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:01.300]  I don't want to go to Chelsea
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.300]  Albert Taylor on the fucking trumpet
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:41.300]  And he's done, he's done, he's shown me
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:48.300]  In a chariot
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.300]  He's been put down
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.300]  But that much rock
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.300]  Stanley up there
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:59.300]  Albert Taylor, Albert Taylor
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.300]  To the bitch
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.300]  John Peele
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.300]  I didn't want ya
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:15.300]  Man with a son
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:19.300]  Albert Taylor, Albert Taylor
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.300]  Benny Dolwich
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:30.300]  Bessie Wunderbaum
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.300]  Sammy Richardson
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:35.300]  Andy Walker
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.300]  Albert Taylor, Albert Taylor
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:45.300]  Albert Taylor, Albert Taylor
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.300]  Albert Taylor
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.300]  Right, thank you.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.300]  Yeah, affectionately known as Albert Tatlock
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:55.300]  That was, of course, the skids and TV stars
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.300]  You know, going back to the opening of the show
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.300]  It took me a long time
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.300]  For anybody that knows me, Stuart Adamson
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:08.300]  Who's very much responsible for me picking up the guitar
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:12.300]  Anyway, he was responsible for me putting down for a spell
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:16.300]  Because he was only really trying to master some of the big country tracks
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.300]  I come to appreciate how difficult the instrument is
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.300]  But thankfully, I didn't have it down too long
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:27.300]  Picked up the guitar and kind of persevered with it
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.300]  That track was, it was actually
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.300]  Well, that track that I just played
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:35.300]  That was on a deluxe version of an album
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.300]  That was re-released fairly recently
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.300]  Scared to Dance, 1979
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:43.300]  The version that I particularly preferred was on
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:45.300]  It was on the B side of Into the Valley
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.300]  And sadly, just through a moment of madness, if you like
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:53.300]  I sold that record
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.300]  Kind of something I regret
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:57.300]  In fact, I've sold quite a lot of records
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.300]  I'm in the process of buying them back at an inflated price
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.300]  Lesson learned there
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.300]  Anyway, that was the B side of Into the Valley
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.300]  And it was a slightly different edit
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:09.300]  Because it continued on at the end
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:12.300]  And Stuart Adamson burst into
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:17.300]  A rather ad hoc jam of Wild Mountain time
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.300]  And it's just the style of his guitar
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.300]  Of his playing rather
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.300]  It's just something else
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.300]  And there you go
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.300]  Actually talking about it makes me a bit sad
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.300]  It's a terrible waste
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:34.300]  And he's a grossly, grossly underrated musician
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:38.300]  Anyway, it seems quite fitting that the next track I play
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.300]  Is a big country track
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:41.300]  This is You Dreamer
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:12:10.300]  Down at the corner store
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:13.300]  Never busy anymore
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:18.300]  He's in the backroom talking high
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.300]  In there all by himself
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:23.300]  Counting bucks up from the shelf
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:29.300]  Watching the window fill with flies
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.300]  Is this the way that you believed
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:40.300]  Your life was gonna turn hell
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.300]  Is this the better world
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:59.300]  That you were making all those plans for
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:02.300]  Meanwhile in the great indoors
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:05.300]  Pizza boxes on the floor
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:10.300]  Prescription junkies past the day
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.300]  TV actors screw around
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.300]  Wrapped in silk and dressing gowns
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:22.300]  A grown-up drama for a day
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.300]  Is this the way that you believed
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:32.300]  Your life was gonna turn hell
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.300]  Is this the better world
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:41.300]  That you were making all those plans for
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:11.300]  You know there's a house on Victory Street
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.300]  Where no one wipes their feet
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.300]  A car is rusting in the yard
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:21.300]  Mommy's crops and daddy's scores
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:24.300]  Kids have stashed beneath the floor
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:29.300]  Under the bed of baby blue
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.300]  I need a guidebook
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:36.300]  I need a guidebook
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.300]  Get me a map
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:44.300]  Not even Indiana Jones could deal with that
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.300]  The tank is empty
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.300]  Oh, we'll game off
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.300]  How can someone find me
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.300]  If no one knows I'm lost
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:58.300]  Hey, if no one knows I'm lost
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.300]  Is this the way that you believed
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:08.300]  Your life was gonna turn hell
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.300]  Is this the better world
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:17.300]  That you were making all those plans for
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:22.300]  Is this the way that you believed
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:27.300]  Your life was gonna turn hell
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.300]  Is this the better world
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.300]  That you were making all those plans for
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:40.300]  You know there's a house on Victory Street
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.300]  Where no one wipes their feet
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:46.300]  A car is rusting in the yard
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.300]  All those plans for
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.300]  Is this the way that you believed
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.300]  Your life was gonna turn hell
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:05.300]  Is this the better world
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:09.300]  That you were making all those plans for
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.300]  Oh, you dreamer
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:16.300]  Is this the way that you believed
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.300]  Your life was gonna turn hell
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:48.300]  It took me quite a while to actually play a big country record
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.300]  For a long time
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.300]  It just somehow affected me
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.300]  It's not as if I knew him
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:59.300]  But yeah, I met him once right enough
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:01.300]  Kind of a bit of a funny story
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:06.300]  My mum, this was back in the album
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.300]  I can't quite remember
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.300]  Steel Town may have been released the album
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.300]  The second album, 94
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.300]  Or it was maybe on the cusp
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:16.300]  But certainly the lead single from it
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.300]  East of Eden had been released
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:22.300]  Because my mum had found out that
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:28.300]  Stuart Adamson was making an appearance at Alan Duffa's Motorcycles in Lesley
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:33.300]  They were interested in there because Stuart had a fascination with the motorbikes
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.300]  And really everything going on in Knock Hill
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.300]  So my mum took me up one Saturday morning
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.300]  There I was, I had my East of Eden
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:43.300]  East of Eden seven and single
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.300]  And up rocked
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:48.300]  I could see Sandra, that's his wife
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:52.300]  Stuart and Callum, that was his son
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.300]  They come in and I was
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.300]  I mean I was just a teenager
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.300]  And I was starstruck
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.300]  So I went up to him
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.300]  And you know, I did better
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:07.300]  Actually in my defence, I did a bit better than ask him what his favourite colour was or something like that
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.300]  Although marginally better, I must admit
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:14.300]  I asked him if a band called White China were going to be supporting him
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:17.300]  Or supporting them rather, not him
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.300]  Supporting them at the Edinburgh Playhouse
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.300]  It was a gig I was due to be going at shortly afterwards
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:24.300]  And he said he wasn't sure
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:29.300]  And for some context, I didn't quite appreciate this at the time
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:32.300]  But White China were also a Dunfermline band
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:38.300]  And Jamie Stewart happened to be Stuart Adamson's brother-in-law
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.300]  He played guitar
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.300]  And you know, I've just actually
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:45.300]  Talking about them
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:47.300]  I'm definitely going to feature on them
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:50.300]  Because they're a band that should definitely have done something
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.300]  And I've got quite a few interesting stories to tell you about them
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:55.300]  Anyway, I digress slightly
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:57.300]  So we were at Alan Duffer's
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:00.300]  So he duly signed the autograph
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.300]  And then I went away
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:06.300]  Unbeknownst to me, it was really when I got my hands on the album
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.300]  I thought, oh my goodness, I couldn't believe it
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.300]  Bruce Watson was standing beside him, of course
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.300]  I'd just seen photos of Bruce from the crossing
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.300]  He had short hair and what have you
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.300]  But he was going through some long hair phase
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:21.300]  And you know, I didn't think he was recognisable
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:24.300]  So I'm a little bit embarrassed about that
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.300]  I could have had both a lot of gas
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.300]  But there you go, I got the main man
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.300]  And that's the point
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.300]  Anyway, I'm talking about Sandra, his wife
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.300]  And Callum, his son
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:38.300]  It's probably worth mentioning his daughter, Kirsten
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.300]  Kirsten Armstrong, a completely musical family
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:48.300]  Kirsten's actually just finished a very successful tour of the Highlands and Islands
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:52.300]  She's more into the Americana scene
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:56.300]  Yeah, I'd say Americana, not contrary as such
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.300]  And what I think is particularly interesting about Kirsten is
[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:05.300]  Like a lot of musicians during that dark time back in 2020
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:10.300]  When, yeah, we'll just call it that dark time
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:15.300]  When musicians were having to stay in locked doors
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:19.300]  They opened their doors in quite innovative ways
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:24.300]  So it was a good opportunity to see John Fogarty, for example
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:26.300]  He opened his doors, he was playing
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:28.300]  And just getting to see how they lived
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:29.300]  Just the male brothers
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.300]  And they were performing like acoustic sets
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:34.300]  And some of them would open up a Patreon account
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:38.300]  Just trying to be a bit creative and imaginative
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.300]  Trying to generate different sources of income
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:44.300]  Anyway, I stumbled across Kirsten
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:49.300]  And I was instantly hooked because unsurprisingly
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:53.300]  She did a fair share of covers of her dad's songs
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:57.300]  But I've got to give credit where it's due
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:04.300]  Her material is, you know, it's Americana, what can I say
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:08.300]  Anyway, this song was actually released
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:12.300]  Oh goodness, let me check my show notes here
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.300]  I can't find it quickly to hand
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:17.300]  But it was released probably a couple of years ago
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.300]  And it's actually paying homage to her dad
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.300]  This is Kirsten Armson and My Father's Songs
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:32.300]  I would listen to my father
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:36.300]  When he talked about the road
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:40.300]  He'd say all you do is hurry up
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:44.300]  And hang around some more
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:48.300]  And I'd wait for him to call each night
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:51.300]  Say he won't be long
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:55.300]  But I never knew my father
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:59.300]  Till I sang my father's songs
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:03.300]  My mother always told me
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.300]  That I sang before I could talk
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.300]  She said life's a dance you have to learn
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:14.300]  Don't run before you walk
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:19.300]  So I spent my time toot singing along
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:22.300]  Learning right from wrong
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:26.300]  But I never knew my father
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:30.300]  Till I sang my father's songs
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:41.300]  The summer days were golden
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:45.300]  On the road my dad and me
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:49.300]  Loaded up on hopes and dreams
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:52.300]  From Fife to Tennessee
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:57.300]  I was searching for a place to land
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:00.300]  Somewhere to belong
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:04.300]  But I never knew my father
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:07.300]  Till I sang my father's songs
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:11.300]  And told me he'll be forever young
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:16.300]  As I carry him in me
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:20.300]  And my journey's just beginning
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:24.300]  Now through his eyes I see
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:43.300]  Now I'll sing to my father
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:47.300]  With the wind howling through the trees
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:51.300]  From heroes' tales to pain and truth
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:55.300]  Sweet Celtic melodies
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.300]  I don't have all the answers
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:02.300]  And some things are best unknown
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:06.300]  For I never knew my father
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:10.300]  Till I sang my father's songs
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.300]  I never knew my father
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:17.300]  Till I sang my father's songs
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:21.300]  No, I never knew my father
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:27.300]  Till I sang my father's songs
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.300]  To suit all your interior needs
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.300]  From luxurious carpets

[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.300]  To a fantastic selection of beds and sofas
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.300]  We have you covered
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.300]  We also supply a range of hand and power tools

[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.300]  Make your house a home
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.300]  Visit us on the high street in Loch Gellie
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:05.300]  Or shop online at broadwayinteriors.co.uk
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.300]  At the coast, one call could save lives
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.300]  Coast Guard
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:15.300]  In an emergency call 999 and ask for the Coast Guard
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:56.300]  I should thank you almost
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:26:01.300]  No one could kill it off until you let it
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:06.300]  But I got rid of that ghost
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:12.300]  With certain habits to remain embedded
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:16.300]  With the shadow of the doubt
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:21.300]  But baby it was you who fed it
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:24.300]  And I don't know what else to say
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.300]  But I think you get it
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:31.300]  I should have known
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:34.300]  That it was coming down to this
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:38.300]  I should have known
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:41.300]  You would betray me but without the kill
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:45.300]  I should have known
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:50.300]  You kind of said that it is
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:54.300]  And always isn't always
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:56.300]  When you smudge your photograph
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:00.300]  I've been keeping you
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.300]  But you're still living those days
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:10.300]  When I stay awake just to watch you sleeping
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:13.300]  You didn't deliver that blow
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:19.300]  But it left a mark on me that you're not seeing
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.300]  And I don't know what else to hear
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:24.300]  But it's not me weeping
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:29.300]  I should have known
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.300]  That it was coming down to this
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:35.300]  I should have known
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.300]  You would betray me but without the kill
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:42.300]  I should have known
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:48.300]  You kind of said that it is
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.300]  I should have seen the cracks in the ceiling
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.300]  And the mirror covered up with dust
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:28:00.300]  But I was busy talking on the phone
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.300]  I should have seen the obstacles
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:06.300]  But I said this house was built for us
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:10.300]  Hello
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:13.300]  Is anybody home?
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:42.300]  I should have known
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:45.300]  The minute that we hit the wall
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:49.300]  I should have known
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:52.300]  That the writing was upon the star
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:56.300]  I should have known
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:59.300]  Cause Rome was starting to fall
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:29.300]  I should have known
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:00.300]  That was Amy Mann and I should have known
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:03.300]  That was from the album Whatever
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:06.300]  Released in 1993
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:09.300]  I first actually come across Amy Mann
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.300]  It was Jules Holland
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:15.300]  I've continually made reference to the old great whistle test
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:20.300]  And there's not really many programs that have followed that in my opinion
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:25.300]  Jules Holland was, in my opinion of course, good for a spell
[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:30.300]  But it's maybe my age and it's more a reflection of how my taste has moved on
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.300]  It maybe is still as good, I don't know
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:36.300]  But I was going through a spell listening
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:39.300]  Coming across quite an amazing amount of bands actually
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.300]  And Amy Mann was one of them
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:45.300]  And Amy Mann of course fronted a band called Till Tuesday
[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:47.300]  In the early 80s
[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:50.300]  And went on to, I was going to say bigger and better things
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:53.300]  But she's had a fairly successful solo career
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:57.300]  And she's collaborated with a lot of musicians
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.300]  On that album Whatever
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.300]  If my memory serves me correctly
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:05.300]  It was John Bryan of course, he played the drums
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:08.300]  Elvis Costello
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:11.300]  And then the follow up to that album Whatever
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.300]  I'm with Stupid
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.300]  That's really where all the stars came out
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:19.300]  Christopher, Glenn Tilbrook
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:22.300]  And my goodness, you stick a microphone in front of me
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.300]  This happened last week
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.300]  I just draw a black
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:29.300]  Anyway, Amy Mann I should have known
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.300]  One other such band
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.300]  That I stumbled across actually on Jules Holland
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:37.300]  Was a band called The Unbelievable Truth
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:40.300]  And they performed this song building
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:43.300]  And don't adjust your headsets
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.300]  Don't think there's anything wrong with the volume
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:48.300]  The way this song starts off quite quiet
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.300]  And builds up to quite a crescendo
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:53.300]  The performance on Jules Holland
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:56.300]  Was something else
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.300]  I tried to source on YouTube
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:02.300]  And I think due to copyright reasons
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:05.300]  I don't know if it's the BBC that have pulled the plug on it
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:08.300]  Or the record company
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:10.300]  Or I don't know
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:12.300]  Anyway, I can't for the life of me find that
[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:14.300]  Because I'd really like to share it
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:17.300]  Because I was really, really taken
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:20.300]  Taken with this performance
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:23.300]  Anyway, we've got the next best thing
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:26.300]  We've got the track building coming up
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:29.300]  But before I do, I'd just like to
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:32.300]  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.300]  The band have released for the first time actually
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:38.300]  On streaming platforms
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:41.300]  And it's available for download
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:44.300]  Miscellaneous tracks
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:48.300]  It'd be really incorrect to say
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:51.300]  That we're on the cutting floor
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:54.300]  Because they're anything but scraps
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:57.300]  You know, they're worthy of an album
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:00.300]  And their own writing, of course, that's what they are
[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:03.300]  Anyway, I really encourage you to check that out
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:06.300]  And I will most definitely, because I have the information for that
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:09.300]  I'll leave the links on the show notes
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.300]  At the sundownsessions.co.uk
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:15.300]  Thank you for tuning in
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:45.300]  Listen to the dead
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:48.300]  Say what you want
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:51.300]  Say what you want
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:59.300]  And did I choose
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:02.300]  To be
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:05.300]  The one who
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.300]  Is left
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:10.300]  Or is this something
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.300]  That's been a stir
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.300]  And is this proof
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:24.300]  Against
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:27.300]  My ignorance
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:30.300]  Or am I
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.300]  Meant to waste away
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.300]  My ignorance
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:46.300]  Or am I
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.300]  Meant to waste away
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:52.300]  My ignorance
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:55.300]  Or am I
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:58.300]  Meant to waste away
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:03.300]  Complete the picture
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:06.300]  With a girl who only
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.300]  Listens to the dead
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.300]  Praise to them
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:15.300]  Please say what you want
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:23.300]  Say what you want
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:26.300]  Say what you want
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.300]  Say what you want
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:32.300]  Say what you want
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:35.300]  Say what you want
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:38.300]  To behave
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:41.300]  This time
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:08.300]  Trapped in a building
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.300]  With the ghosts of
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.300]  All the people
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.300]  I betrayed
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:20.300]  Say what you want
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:23.300]  Say what you want
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:29.300]  There's no reason
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:32.300]  To step out
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:35.300]  To a nation
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:38.300]  That won't see me
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:41.300]  Say what you want
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:44.300]  Say what you want
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.300]  And is this proof
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:55.300]  Again
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:58.300]  My ignorance
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:01.300]  Or am I
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:04.300]  Meant to waste away
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:12.300]  Did I choose
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:15.300]  To be
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:18.300]  The one
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:21.300]  Who has left
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:24.300]  Or is this something
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:27.300]  That's been a stir
[01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:30.300]  Say what you want
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:33.300]  Say what you want
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:38.300]  Say what you want
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:41.300]  Say what you want
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:46.300]  Say what you want
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:49.300]  Say what you want
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:54.300]  Say what you want
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:57.300]  Say what you want
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:14.660]  Now, as I fade out, I'm going to give you 8 seconds to find yourself a pair of headphones
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:15.660]  so you can hear.
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:18.420]  You can really, truly, truly appreciate this.
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:24.260]  And if you don't have a pair of headphones, well, yeah, well, it's not too late.
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:26.980]  Just turn that volume up to number 11.
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:34.420]  Now, if you're a Visage fan or you have this album, you all know this, but chances are
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:35.420]  you may not.
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:42.020]  This is probably more of an obscure track, but it's every bit as good as the ones that
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:43.500]  you're probably more familiar with.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:00.580]  So shrewd, black hat, cold eyes
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:07.580]  Pointed foot, no heart, never cries
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:13.980]  Hot sun, desert sand, one man
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:20.980]  On his own, steps alone, never end
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:54.980]  No ties, no claims, no name
[01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:00.980]  Man of fancy, man of fortune, man of fame
[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:07.980]  No show, gotta go, Mexico
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:14.980]  Every man wanna be mother, so
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:26.980]  No
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:56.980]  No
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:15.980]  So shrewd, black hat, cold eyes
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:22.980]  Pointed foot, no heart, never cries
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:28.980]  Hot sun, desert sand, one man
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.980]  On his own, steps alone, never end
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:57.980]  No ties, no claims, no name
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:27.980]  So shrewd, black hat, cold eyes
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:43:01.980]  Here you go, that was Visage. From the album, Visage, released back in 1980, and that was
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:07.980]  a track called Mild Pastel Man, and really it's got Madure's fingerprints all over that,
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:12.980]  and you know Steve Strange, obviously, naturally, with him fronting the band. He was credible
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:20.980]  a lot, but I do think Madure was instrumental in a lot of their work. In fact, really everything
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:27.980]  he touches, it turns to gold. Anyway, sticking with the kind of new romantic theme, just
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:32.980]  while that was playing, I had a text from Jane from Leith, so it's nice to know that
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:37.980]  not everybody's watching the football tonight. Anyway, really enjoying the show, Colin. A
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:44.980]  lot of favourites played tonight. Well, that's really good to hear. I do recall that you
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:51.980]  sent a text, probably on my first show, first or second show. Well, only on my third show,
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:58.980]  so it was one of those shows. And you actually gave me a list, it seems you have a lot of
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:04.980]  favourites, Jane. Anyway, this one, this next one I've lined up especially for you, because
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:11.980]  I know this is indeed one of your favourites, and it actually takes me back to a time when
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:17.980]  I used to go to, I was at Disco, if my memory serves me correctly, I think it was at the
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:23.980]  Locomotion Roadshow, a bit sketchy, but I remember it was in the Thornton Junction anyway,
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:30.980]  and it was kind of a teeny boppers, it was maybe on a Monday night, and everybody, looking
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:37.980]  back now, everybody was up thinking they were dancing like Jim Kerr, and in 14-year-old
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:44.980]  eyes, I thought everybody who was doing it looked really cool. I do wonder what they
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:48.980]  would think if I saw them now. Anyway, this is Simple Minds.

[01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:40.340]  I actually have a special special guest who's going to be popping in. It's Kenny Armour from
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:47.940]  Andy's Man Club and so our section about Geordie Munro. There's a section that I've called Geordie
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:55.220]  Munro. We'll be talking about what Andy's Man Club is and how it's serving the Kirkcaldy area.
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:56:00.660]  Until then, hopefully I'll see you next week. We're going to play out with the filthy tongues.
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:56.180]  you
