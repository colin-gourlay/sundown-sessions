It's Windy Miller. Hello, Wendy. Are you busy? Plenty of corn to grind.
Plenty of wind in your sails.
Oh yes, they're going nicely, aren't they?
Windy Miller Windy Miller Sharper than a thorn like a mouse, his spry and nimble when he grinds the corn like a bird. He'll watch the wind and listen for the sound, which says he has the wind he needs to make the sails go round.
Phew, it's warm work being a Miller.
This Tuesday evening on East Coast FM, and that means one thing. Yes, the Sundown Sessions is back, bringing you the finest music to grace of turntables through the decades. And when I say back, I'm back from no holiday. But it's more of a pilgrimage really. I spent the last two weeks over in the States taking in everything from the Casino recording studio in New Orleans, Sun Studios in Memphis, and then just yesterday the famous Studio RCA Studio Be in Nashville. But tonight is back to business. I'm back in studio.
In the heart, Arlington where? East Coast FM, excuse me here, East Coast FM and besides some great music from the Mission, Estes and ZZZ, I have Jay and JoJo from the band post Ironic State joining me for a live interview very very soon. So well they make their way in and with me only flying back.
In 10, by this afternoon, I'm very much still on A, and it'd be very, very easy for me to talk at length about what I've been up to for the last two weeks. But I'm going to spare you all the detail and just sum it all up, saying that if you ever get the chance to do the whole Rock'n'roll Tour thing in the States, you really, really must do it. Because it truly was something else.
There she comes.
Here comes that girl again, wanted to beat her since I don't know where but she don't notice me when I pass she goes with all the guys from her out of my class but it didn't stop me from my thinking myself. She's your violin looking man, she's something else.
Hey, look at them across the street.
Where's the car in just for me to own that car would be a luxury, but right now I can't afford the gas. A brand looking vertical is out of my glass but that didn't stop it from my thinking to myself and cars. Fine looking man. Get something else, get something else.
Hey, look at here. Just wait and see.
If I can save my dog, I'll buy that car that I've been worth. So get me that girl and we'll go riding around. You'll look me your shot with a white drop down. I'll keep right on a dream and I'm thinking to myself when it all comes true man, wow, that's something else.
Look at here. What's all this?
Before, but here I am knocking on the door.
My cars have fun, it's all mine. Just a 41 foot, not a 59. I got that girl and I'm thinking to myself, she's sure Vine looking man. Wow, she's something else.
Here, the Rock'n'roll in one minute, 59 seconds. And in that short space of time I've actually had a couple of texts, a couple of messages rather. I've heard a text that's come in the studio from Ray. Ray says good evening calling. How are you doing? Well, I'm doing terrific Legacy. I'm very, very much.
The windows are my sales just to kind of latch onto their Wendy Miller from Cumberland Green there. But yeah, I'm, I'm just not going to go on about my holiday slash pilgrimage because, yeah, I think everybody will drop off. It will just be like inviting everybody around to come and look at my photographs. It's just a bit too much. But I'm doing really, really good. And I hope you are too. And thanks so much for tuning in. And, you know, it's just been away these two last two weeks. You might have easily found something else to do. So.
You could join me. And John Lighthart sent a message on the Facebook page. He says welcome back. Oh, and go yourself. Colin. Sounds like you had a great trip. Well, yeah, the two years tease me as you might and trying to get the information. I'm just. I just wanted to see. It was something else. It really was because because really, when I start, I could just. I'll just never know when to stop. It was just absolutely terrific. It really, really was. But if anybody else wants to get in touch, I'd really love to hear from you. Well, that's just to say hello or if you've got a question that you want me to.
To either Jay or JoJo from Post Ironic State, then there's a number of ways you can reach me. You can text the studio on 0785902030 or you can drop a comment on the Sundown Sessions Facebook page. Surprisingly enough on Facebook if you just look for Sundown Sessions.
UK, you should be able to find me there. But back to the music, I were listening to Eddie Cochran, something else. I was originally released back in 1959 on the London American label. Well in the UK RPM version you know that set you back about £250 upwards of that anyway. But well the earlier 7 inch try center pressings, they just reach.
Price about 30 and then the solid center versions, which obviously they're later pressions, they're around £15. But with all that being said, what you just heard, there was none of those. It was none of those. It was actually a rare stereo mixer from my personal collection that picked up record for many may many years ago and actually consider that bit of a gem. And Speaking of all these records, there was a time that you in the London American label actually just prompted me really there was a time.
Many, many years ago that you could really tell what kind of signs you were in for just looking at the label in the sleeve. London American. Like I say, it was Auk imprint that licensed and released American records in Britain, especially the kind of rock'n'roll rhythm and Blues and pop from the 50s and 60s. And they included what a roster asterisk artists they had Cochran, Del Shannon, Jean Vincent, Roy Orbison. Then there was a Parlour phone label anymore, The Beatles, The Hollies, Columbia, Columbia Records.
Cliff in the Shadows, Helen Shapiro, Adam Faith, you know, rattling all these off because just just talking about London American actually takes me back to time when me, my sister were kids, my dad had banging olives. And for anybody who knows, banging olives and back in the 70s and still still true to this day, for that matter, they're very much more like pieces of furniture.
Rather than just a stereo, if you will. So yeah, the banging Alderson front and center in the living room and he had hit less stack of records and he'd play kind of. Is this going to be a hit?
Obviously he knew the answer to that, but we were just kids and I think it was just an excuse for to make us kind of listen to those records And, you know, I just hovered them all up. Absolutely love them. Got really, really fond memories and actually just kind of recounting that there just had a flashback there just now. I remember rocking Goose, but Johnny and Eric and that was a that was a real, real favorite of mine.
Anyway, but he Cochran, to me, he really epitomizes rock'n'roll, the clothes, the imagery, everything. And when I see the imagery, I'm talking about the cars, the diners. I mean, even like on on later releases, you know, they had the car with big tailgates. This spotlight records Silver spotlight. Somebody's going to please somebody correct me. I've just gone blank, but basically.
But back to Eddie himself, like, you know, the Cliff and yes, that guitar has Gretch, absolutely beautiful looking, beautiful looking guitar. I was just absolutely seduced the look of it. And Eddie, you know, saggy, sad. Sadly, his life was tragic cut short on April the 17th, 1960 when he died in a car crash. Anyway, I've got some trivia for you. One of the people that was first on the scene was a young police cadet named David Harmon.
And you might know him better as Dave D from Dave D Dozy Becky Macintosh. And they had big, big hits like Hold Tight and The Legend Designer do.
Eddie Cox and was actually portrayed by a chap called Brian sits other than the 1980 some for 1980 some film and that was a biopic biopic about Richie Valencia and really sex or was a fitting choice and he brought real authenticity to the rule normally did he look that part but it's performance you know it was absolutely spot on for fans of that either and sits on himself has had a long standing collaboration with Gretch resulting several signature more.
Models that pay homage to has rockability roots and distinctive sale. And if you're sitting at home thinking who on earth is Brian Setzer? Well in 1979 with Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom, he formed the stray Cats and really after learning of the rockabilly rockabilly revival in the UK, he relocated here in 1980. And it was then the Dave Airman's kind of took notice and produced their self-titled Debbie album stray Cats and that was recent records and the album featured hits like runaway boys.
Cut straw and this this is rock this down.
Well, they need me. Well, late Saturday night I had my hair part time and the baby just looks so right home. We can't pick up 10. Got to have it over to you. But I don't know, I got something in the bed so bad 'cause we're looking at schools.

Get out of here right away. We're going to rock this town. Rock it inside out. We're going to rock this town. Make them scream and chat.
Let's rock, rock, rock and rock TV. Papa gonna rock tea drop. We're gonna rock this down, rock it inside out.

Just about another big dance floor.
What is the real square candy looks in 1974?
Wait, hey, look at me once you look at me twice, look at me again. And is it going to be?
This place apart, we don't want to rock this town. Rock it inside out. We're going to rock this time, think on the screen and shine.
Please. Rock, rock, rock me and Rock Jamie. Papa gone around to each other. Rock this town. Rock this place to fall.

We're going to rock this town, rock it inside out. We're going to rock this time. Pick them, screen and share.
This rock, rock, rock and rock along Rocky with Papa going to Rock You inside out.
We're gonna rock this time. Rock it inside out.
We'll rock this town, rock it each time.
Wow.
There you go, the stray cats and rock this.
Town and like part of my preamble before I played that I was kind of given a notch to the notch, a nod to the Gretch guitar. But really great guitars are not unique to him. In fact, there's my goodness, there's an absolute ton of famous, famous musicians that have, you know, played, played the gratches, the really big obvious ones, I guess George Harrison, Dwayne, Eddie Bosborough.
I could go on and on, Atkins and what have you, but it was really like for me, as much as I was kind of seduced by them, when I saw Eddie Cochran first play them, for me it was really after seeing Billy Duffy play a great White Falcon, I knew that one day, one day I really had to have one. I was just, I thought they were absolutely, This sounded amazing. I was at the age where the album Love was just released and it looked.
Looked and sounded absolutely terrific and I really was and I remember at the time.
About 8586 went up to it was in the West End, but it was a it was a music shop. It's not there anymore. And there was there was a great white Falcon with a gold plated rims and what have you. It was behind a glass cabinet. You had to ask for permission to have a shot of it. But I mean, I'm always a wee bit shy anyway in the, in the record shops and the music shops, you know, picking up and playing. I don't know, there's something about it. I'm just uncomfortable doing it. But.
But really, that had a price tag. Now, it's a lot of money in today's money, you know, it was £4999. That's a lot of money and today's money. But back in, back in 85, my goodness, I just looked at it. That's all I could do. Just look hands on the glass, looking through the window, just like one day. One day. Well, well, maybe anyway. Yeah. So I was like I say, I was really, really seduced by that. And.
Which leaves me rather nicely on to I'm talking about Billy Duffy. Billy Duffy himself is actually heard recently. He's got collaborated with Gretch as well and he's got his own signature Gretsch guitar, Mr. White Folk. He's actually got Black Falcon as well. And he plays, I'm saying played past tense. He still plays them. But really when they went into electric and really the hard rockier stuff, he seemed to favor Les Paul's and what have you, but for me.
Up to the point of love, like that was my favorite kind of cult era. And so I'm going to play a track from the album Love. And this, interestingly enough, features Mark Brezinski on drums. I think I may have told this story before. The curious fact about this album is that Mark Brazezki from Big Country played drums on every single track on this album with the exception of Cecil saying this, saying this on the radio. Say this slowly. She sells sanctuary.
It's a tongue twister, Yes, we played trums on it. Every track apart from that. And rather ironically, he appears in the video of She Sells Sanctuary, but none of the others. Anyway, without much further ado from the album Love This Is the Cult and Big Neon Glitter.


















Well, that absolutely takes me back. Big neon glitter by the cult that appeared on the the album Love, which was my goodness. I played that absolute death when I got that when Santa.
When Santa pop that in my but it come down the chimney and really round about the time I used to well originally healing from faith, there was record shop in Kirkcaldy called Sleeves Records.
Was of the age at the round about time out for Kent. Frequent that place just every Saturday, but down there just hanging around really kind of perusing, just looking all the other stuff and over a period of time because you know, spending all my cash down there like Neil, Jackie and what have you. I got to know them fairly well and obviously just the nature. I'm having a record shop. He's definitely got his finger on the pulse and I missed this next track the first time.
When it came out, I really relate the cult on the mission, he said it was a time because the mission were kind of gaining a bit of traction with the release of Wasteland, there was a bit of renewed interest and the band, the Sisters of Mercy. So Neil said, you know, you want to check out this, this 12 inch year was Alice. That's pretty good. So I started moving up their back catalog as well. And this is it's not Alice I'm going to play. This is another favorite.
Mind, this is Andrea.

From the album Children, that was the mission beyond appeal and that was the opening track from from that album and really since since it's been released.
Pretty much features in every set list that they play alive and more often. Notice the the opening well following the the the intro when the band are coming.
On playing the damn Busters.
Typically with that, and I was going to say typically because it besides law, next time they play live, they probably won't open with that. And I'm saying next time they play live, hopefully that'll be real, real soon because there's a band member that said that's not keeping too well. And unfortunately they had to cancel their North American trip, North American trip, the North American leg of a tour where they were supporting the psychedelic first. And you know, I'm just me and my gig buddy. We're going down to it was.
There was a fan club only it kicked down ahead and Bridge. I think it was limited to about 100 and 5200 people and basically it was a warm up. It was a precursor to a bigger tour and they were showcasing. They've got some new material. I think there's an album in the world. Well I've seen an album in the works. I think it's done and dusted as a case it's going to be released, but I think that may have been shelled for the time being. But you know, as soon as I hear anything I'll be I'll definitely be keen to share it.
And it's apparent I've seen many, many times, and I'm talking about a fan club only gig coming up. It was just a year or so, maybe two years ago, went down to Wolverhampton with good friend of mine and we went to see it's quite, quite bit to go into go and see them. But the reason was that Angel were supporting them. Big, big favorites of mine and another band called Estes, who admittedly I hadn't heard of.
But we went down there and but you know, a few bars into their first song is this. We both knew. We both knew we were witnessing something really, really special. I mean, they were they were absolutely terrific. They're really, really well. So I'm going to play. It was a favorite from mine from the from the debut album least back in a couple of years ago.
Was it 2000 and I need to?
Get my show notes here. I think it was 2020. Anyway, from the album Architecture, this is a track called your.

Assistance in your mind.
Perseverance overall.
Trying to make the mind the body.
So too.
Past the time.
You'll find.
Your mind.
Your mind, Your mind.
Your mind, Your mind.
'S overall things.
Removes the joy of winning now.
I need to remiss this.
I don't understand the essence of life, the life that we possess.
Your mind.
You're mine.
Your mind.
Your mind, Your mind.


Yeah, so just while I was playing, I went off onto Discogs and corrected myself there. So that was from the 2020 DB album Architecture and I was a track called Your Mind and there actually touring right now and they just seem to be touring all the time really. But they're coming. They're just playing one day in Scotland. They're playing the Caves and then but on Thursday the 1st of me in 2025 and I'm going to leave some ticket and information in the show notes.
Because believe no, there's still some tickets left. I've since seen them several times and the first time, like I said before played that when they were supporting Blamin Angel in the mission and I've seen them several times. The food rooms played Edinburgh play them classical lot as well. But one notable time was when they played at King Tuts when the support act was post ironic state and my opinion they gave us this real run for money on on that note.
I'm absolutely delighted that both G and JoJo from the band are here. So welcome. Thank you. Thanks for having us. No, thank you. Thank you for so much for swinging by the studio because I do know you've got quite a hectic schedule. What within recent weeks you've had, well, you had a single launch. You've got plenty gigs video shooting.
As well, but we'll talk all about that a little bit later on and that King Touch gig if you don't mind. Yeah, of course. But before that we just had some messages in there and Jane from Musselburgh has sent a message to saying have they arrived yet? Well, I think we've already answered. I think we've already answered your question and Lorraine sent a message saying that she's really enjoying the show so far. We'll stick around Lorraine because it's about to get better. Like I say, if you've not heard of post ironic say you're in for.
Real, real treat tonight. And yeah, I think, I think before we get a little chat underway, just kind of let you get settled in the studio, get the kettle on, what have you. But we'll play a song from I think it was 2021, wasn't it, playing Impressions? Yeah, we put out during lockdown and recorded during lockdown, which was an interesting experience.
Maybe talk about that another side of this, of course, Yeah. So this is a plain impressions.

With those companies, the one I keep reminders at home for shatter the heart, even the mind, our thoughts. I don't know what could be if it was you changes the constant, so is the feeling. Mercy is fine, but the torture events crying aloud, no, some will notice with her softly, when nobody cares.
A picture of Bear Fruit Drum and Peggy carefully lay inside the way side of the way, and a memory of sauce is out from the fear. Everything is all resetting, but this isn't how your memory works.

Slowly a treacherous existence is existence yet offensive to be, but still you are a shameful admit. This is something so pure. There's a reason to smile at the fairies mess and the reason to die. At the very worst the drunker finds the worse the cause and those who are nervous.
What's your favorite trial? In fact, but so we will see your time. This isn't how your memory works, and it isn't how you attack. You watch. This is how the realizators are slowly wasting your time. This is how a relax occurs. But it's only wasting your time.

A reference to fame are often mess, get at us slowly face a treacherous existence is existence yet offensive to be, but still you are a shamefulness or something so pure. There's a reason to smile at the very best, and a reason to die at the very worst. The drunkard mind the worst, the cause and those who under abroad.
It's your favorite time now.




That was plain impressions by post ironic state. And as we said before that that played there was at least just during COVID. And I did talk about the guy King touch, which was just last year, wasn't it? Last year? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So last year and then there's COVID. But you also have quite a history. I mean, to be honest with you first came up married. But really, I'd really like to go back to the very, very beginning because I mean, I know you've got a number of singles on Spotify. So you you have been around for for a number of years. So you want to kind of talk me through the genesis of the band, how it all really came about? Yeah. So the band actually started. It was me and four other people.
And it was a university kind of like project.
We all studied music. That's how everyone met. And after the original synth player left, I was kind of having a bit of a panic. Who do we ask? Like who's going to play synth? And then the baseball entertainment. What about JoJo? JoJo likes that kind of musicals. Like that's a great idea. And then kind of over time, kind of we kind of lost the original drummer, lost that bass player. And it was just me and JoJo for a little while, just kind of sitting in our various bedrooms and then just kind of writing stuff. And that's where we got.
Like, what the hell, Grinning Bear, all these kind of songs that are now like a staples in our sets. And then we were booked for a gig. Ivory Blacksmith, like, oh, we don't have a drummer or a bass player, So what do we do here? And at the time I was living with Ross or drummer, So I asked him. It was like, do you fancy kind of coming along? He's like, I'll stick around for like maybe a gig or two just if he's needed.
And then you knew Elliott pointing over at JoJo.
Knew Elliott, our bass player from way back, so we asked him if he wanted to join as well and he was like yeah, sure, I can do that. He didn't know any post punk music, he didn't know any new wave bands. So it was a bit of a risk in his part as well. We played the gig and then we just kept playing gigs together and then that was it. That was kind of the inception of the band and in terms of like the name and stuff like that, we, the old band, put it to a vote.
I did not vote for post ironic State, but that was the the result of the vote. And by the time we released a song, it was too late to change. So that's us now. That's supposed to ironic State. I voted for it. Yeah, you did vote for it. And I told you my suggestion like a year later, you're like, oh, that is a better name. Yeah. Thanks.
Exactly. It's good that you're able to kind of work through that. Actually, I've been a bit tardy during my introduction. I should have said so. Jay, you're the singer. And JoJo.
Plays the keys, so apologies for that.
So you were saying, just tracking back a little bit when you said about the university band and so we all the university together or is it just friendship that you and JoJo have or was it through the university? Like me, Jay and Ross were like the only three music students on our course induction. And like one of the first things that they said to us was don't stay friends with the people you meet first. And we are literally like the only people that we know from uni that was like actually remain friends so.
I don't know, it's weird because we didn't really hit it off because we had like similar tastes in music as such, we just kind of got on as people. So I think that that's kind of why we've always like worked well together because we've always been able to kind of balance things and work things out. So so the way it come around. So when when you are, as you say, you're sitting writing song, a lot of songs together, at what point did you think, right, this is, you know, we're going to make a real go. This is going to be a proper band.
Think like the moment where we said we're going to make a real go off. It was my cousin was actually he owned a record label in Sterling for a bad time and they asked him if he wanted to manage us. He went well, I've not got a lot of time to manage a band but I'll give you some advice just now. He said if you're recording your first single soon spend. A lot of bands will spend £100 on their first single. If you say to the band you want to spend £500 that will show them who's committed and you'll get a great sounding song at the end of it.
So I put that suggestion forward and then everyone was on board. So I was like, oh, fantastic. And then we booked in to our studio in Dundee and then we recorded what the hell is going on? And then I remember it was like the night that we got the because we just kind of got like a bounce down off like the kind of like what we've done that day because we had to do in two sessions. And I remember listening going oh this is great. Like that's genuinely sounds fantastic. But the problem was I was a terrible guitar player so.
We were kind of late, right? We need a guitarist. And then we we asked our friend at the time just do you fancy, you know, kind of playing guitar for a wee bit? And he was like, yeah, sure, whatever, I'll come back and do that. He was actually the original guitarist in the band as well, but he ended up leaving just for other commitments. But we came back and and then we played one gig with him in Perth. I think it was the green room at the time, her Mucky's, whatever it's called now. But we played a gig there and then we went, oh, that was.
The best gig we've ever played kind of thing like it was when everything came together, I was able to kind of perform more. Like that was when the kind of infamous jumping about on stage and looking about mentals kind of came from.
And it kind of just allowed me to focus more on a performance as opposed to, you know, being in a band kind of thing. And that was the moment all clicked for everyone. Like that was as soon as we've done that, that was we got offered to play King Tuts for the first time for one of their summer nights. We were booked in for all kinds of gigs after because we couldn't get a gig when we first started out. We just, no one was booking us, no one was touching us. And then as soon as we played that gig.
There was like people that we just like that we knew and other bands, like there was some of the members from what disco followed us after that. Yeah, yeah. And that was that was that was the moment. And I think like that's every time we point back at like the moment we're like, oh, you know, should we continue this? Should we be a band? That's the moment that I always think of was coming off stage after that first sex. We were just supporting a kind of local band at the time.
But after us, most of the people left because they thought that just the gig was over and because it was like a four band lineup or something like that. But after us, they just left and then we can went, oh, that's this is what we're going to do now. It's interesting when you're saying about, and I'm sure you take this in the spirit that I mean when you're saying you're dancing around crazy. I mean, I'm really keen to come to the King touch gig thing.
Witness but there's plenty of time for that but.
You as a collective view because JoJo, you just yeah, again, we'll come to the king touch. But you did see yourself that you jump around. You're crazy. I can't help. And I mean this in a complimentary way that your presence is about like in Cutters. Definitely. Is that deliberate or just the music? You just get so into the music.
It was definitely a bit of both a thing because like definitely my biggest inspiration when I wanted to, like the moment I wanted to start a band was when I saw a record, just a record fair and it was closer by Joy Division. So I bought that record and then it was a few songs and I was like, no, I could do this. I could do this. And that was when I was like, I was like, I need to start a band. I need to do something more than just like, you know, kind of join a few friends at uni and then kind of having a jam session like I need to.
Writing this type of stuff, this is brilliant. And I'll start to research a bit more. And I saw that he was a bit more mental on stage and went well, yeah, that's how you that's how you're remembered is you're not you're not going to remember the singer that's, you know, kind of standard in the one spot hugging his microphone stand all night. But you all remember the one who's jumped off stage and stared you down. So that was kind of that. But the actual the biggest changed because I used to be that singer, but the biggest change to how I performed was actually watching like me and JoJo went to see what disco.
I think it was in Dundee who went to see them and I remember seeing them and just going, no, that's that's what I want to do on stage, that I want to be crazy on stage. I want to like whip the crowd into a frenzy every single time. And it was just such a change to have a kind of worked as a front man. But it was just seeing, I suppose, Jocelyn doing their.
Like their front person performance was just life changing at that point. It was just that's everything I wanted to be as a singer.
That's really interesting. There's not many people I have to see that I've come across that. I've come across both disco. I've played them a couple of times in the past.
And well, when our regular listeners, actually John Lighthart, he chained and he sent some messages and saying he saw them, they were the sport of simple minds.
And maybe it's just the circles are moving and you know, because they are back, they're actually doing a bit North America. They're certainly in the States just now they're doing quite a quite a lengthy tour or they're about to embark on one rather. It's a 2 month thing was made June or it could be June, July. But yeah, Glasgow band just going back a little bit. You actually saying just for the listeners out there, I think I know what you mean when you're talking about. Yeah, you got the tracks bounce, you're bounced. Oh, sorry. Explain what? Yeah, sorry. So.
And Don't Attract is essentially when you've recorded a song, it's basically just kind of summing everything up that you've done. So all the guitars, all the keys, drums, everything like that. So on day one, because we actually recorded over two months because that was just, I was a bartender at the time, I think Ross was working in retail, stuff like that. So it was just the only time we could get was a month apart. So we recorded the first one and that was drums, bass, and.
Some synth, so not all since just some synth. And he summed it all together. So kind of made a mix of that and then bounced it down, which is basically just exporting it from his recording software to I think it was just an MP3 file they sent us. And then just said, Yep, here's what that sounds like so far. Let me know if we're on the right path. And that was what the Hell's going on. And I've still got that mixed down that he sent us because it was, I remember like showing his people and they're like, oh, that sounds like something of Stranger Things because it was a 2018.
19 sorry. And it was obviously at the height of its popularity at the time and we were like, Oh my God, that's that's like stranger things like that sounds like something that could be in the soundtrack. Oh, well, we're clearly on the right lines here then.
With that, so I'm going to play what the hell is going on just real shortly. But just when we were chatting there was just laying up. You did mention Joy Division. So because it's a band that's kind of dear to your heart, This is Love will tear us apart.




Turn away on your own side is my time in the floor. I respect your soul.
And there's still blessing in the morning.
Love, love, love and terror of the party again.
Love never tears apart again.



















There you go, 2 tracks back-to-back there and choice tracks from Jay and JoJo. That was a level tear us apart. The Joy Division and World Disco bandits featured on the show before. Not that tracker I have to say. Drowning in your velvet bed. Now where were we? What the hell is going on? I couldn't. I couldn't help myself there and fun wasn't. It was intended actually.
So going back to, I've been down to talk about this really when I first saw you. So we're coming up to more recent times, really when when I saw you play at King Tut's. I mean, how did that all come about? I think we were offered that gig about, what was it 24 hours before? Not even. No. Was it less than that? Yeah. And we actually, we couldn't promote it as well because we had another contract. Yeah, that was I yeah, we had another gig too soon after it, so we couldn't actually say that we were doing it.
But it actually ended up being like one of the best gigs like that we've done. Like, it was really strange because it seemed just like the right crowd. And I think it went down well because when we got there, I think we're all a bit worried that people would be like who?
These guys, because it's this are already quite established and it's like, yeah, it was quite nerve wracking, but it did seem to work. I thought as on the other side of the mic when I can tell you what what spectacular which is, which is really why we're here tonight. And of course I was we're talking off microphone and and I've actually on previous shows when when I've actually played some of your material have talked about it.
I'm going to use the word stage presence, but it's not just the stage because you come off stage to it. It's just your presence. So really it's an absolute sight to behold. If we'll talk about this a little bit later on about some gigs in the future. But really if you, if you, you know, you get the chance listeners out there, they get chance to go and see them really, really encourage you because it's an absolute experience. You know, it's hypnotic actually watching, watching them and then something.
I don't know. Is that a bit of a spoiler? Can I, can I say yeah, into into the crowd or certainly off the stage. And I need to actually ask you because it's not just like you're banging a drum. Yeah, it's actually double drum. And you're playing in absolutely sink with with the drummer. Oh, yeah. Are you a drummer? Have you got? No, No, that was I used to every time you would like, leave the rehearsal space to go to the toilet, I would just immediately plug myself behind his drums to annoy him.
But it was, it was just because we used to practice like 6 hours kind of every week and that was all we would do was just try looking like lock in with each other And while doing it because like we would, because like that's how we actually kind of got that idea for Citadel was there was an extra floor to him just kicking about the rehearsal space that we used at the time. And we were trying to think of something to do for the bridge section. And we went, oh, it's already quite arrhythmic. Sorry, arrhythmic song. So why don't like, you know, I'll just go out, you know?
For, you know, like kind of 5 minutes and then we'll get.
See what we can do and what's kind of surprising is that from the very first like recording of got off us playing all of that together is that the drum part is not changed at all. And I thought maybe we can have change up here and there, but it's been pretty much beat for beat identical. But it was kind of Ross's idea to kind of build up. So he was like, all right, OK, So what won't you do is kind of start kind of like done, done, done, done and then.
Like the kind of part afterwards, I was kind of like, oh, I want to kind of maybe do build into that because I think it was a Cure song or something that's kind of got a very similar like kind of drum pattern. So I want to kind of build it into that. But it was we can have we got the idea off kind of bringing it out into the stage and not bringing it out in the stage, but kind of using a floor Tom for myself. Because there was a band that we saw before, I think was that Ivory Blacks and their singer kind of went behind the drums with the.
And start to play the floor Tom and there's an idea it was kind of Frost just kind of brought his own floor to the extra floor Tom along. And then it was eventually I started to bring it out into the crowd. It's only been in the last year or two that I've started to do that because I used to just kind of put it on the stage. But it's been very recently they've started to go and I'll bring it into the crowd because it does. It creates a very memorable experience for people. It's all about the final engagement. And you know, I have to say it's not it's not all about Jay JoJo exactly.
I'm the singer, so have to have to shine a little bit. It's really, really difficult to describe a really your stage presence as it really, really is something else. And it's interesting when you see I mean really it's a case. I think it's the stars were aligned. I mean you're saying that the call was on short notice, something that you've we've talked about off off Mike.
Do you want to talk about the guitarist the for that particular gig? Oh yeah, the notice.
I'm still on your thumb. No, I think he, he only had like, what was it 1/2 hour rehearsal before that gig? Yeah. And then we were like, Oh yeah, you're playing TOTS. And I think we, we told him who it was and it was like, is this? And we were like, they're quite established. I think he was definitely panicking at the time. We felt kind of bad about it because it was like genuinely his first gig with us. And he like he learned the songs really fast. He did really, really well. But I think I had a guitar solo. So wait, what?
Beckon call and that has a guitar so yeah, you know what that's what I'm saying the stars must be in the line and so with that he's had really limited practice yeah. Just short notice for the gig. You were all really nervous I can absolutely tell you you wouldn't know and it wasn't just about me the. Like you say that you're probably playing to the right crowd as well because your music isn't really. And I mean that's in the in the best possible way it's not too far removed from that genre I feel like. Oh no, of course so you were playing to to the right crowd and you.
Very well. Well, well received, actually. You're talking about the songwriting. Do you want to touch on about it? We've got the next single lined up here. What the hell is going on? Do you want to? Yeah, I would say like, yeah, like I'd say like the songwriting, it very much changes. Like we all kind of have our own input and we all come up with ideas. I'd say that for me, it's definitely like I can come up with like a melody in my head and then.
Usually like, right, like play it on the piano or something, and then I can send it to the band and say, what do you think? And then they can play off of that. But then Jay comes up with lyrics sometimes and he'll, I think you can probably usually come with lyrics prepared. And then if they happen to fit into a song, then I'll use them. Yeah. Because it was just like, for Citadel in particular, it was just kind of a miracle that I had those ones that fit so well. But what the hell was like? It was, I remember you. You sent that. I've got this old recording. Yeah. And all that.
Like, you know, you're 17. Yeah. I wrote that when I was 14. And it sat on my old phone for, like, years. And, like, I always put, like, a lot of my recordings on YouTube and then forget about them, like just on private YouTube. And then I was just going through, like, old videos. And I was like, oh, there's some old stuff that written. And I was like, oh, that's quite a good one. So I sent it to Jay. And Jay was like, oh, yeah, that's quite decent. We turned it into a song.
We rewrote it in the studio as well when we went to record it, just completely rewrote it. Yeah. I, I know we've kind of played about with doing that a few times as well. Like, I think ideas, they can kind of change when you get into like actually a recording setting. Yeah. Which I don't know, it can be good because you can come up with some new, like bad things. Yeah. So. So going back to that time when you, when you wrote it, were you, are you, I mean, I know you play the keyboards, but like when you're composing stuff, is it all?
Boards or is it a guitar or it's really the keyboards? But I would say it's kind of funny because like I'd say like my biggest musical inspiration is Johnny Moore, which I think is more like melody wise. Like I just like the melt, like the melodies he comes up with like I just find them really like just pretty and like really nice. So I'd say like he was growing up, he was definitely like my biggest musical inspiration, but I've never been a guitar player. I've always been like a piano player and then.
Player and I got into sense because of Jay, because I'm really technologically inept, but Jay isn't so programming is done by me for Georgia because I can't play but Georgia can. So I program everything and then send it to JoJo and then JoJo can play. So yeah, so we work together well. So it seems Jay is quite a handyman. So if I'm going to leave some, I'll leave a link in the in the show notes. I'll need to take it out of course, but.
Yeah, you put together was a condenser make out of AI, don't want to say the brand.
Should we say a beer?
You're quite a handyman, it seems. Yeah. No, that's we used to record a single just the other week there, which the producer was a big fan of, which we now get free beer off of that brand as well. So that's. Wow. So there you go. I actually thought I'm just goofing around in the show. You've actually used it? Yeah. No, it was because it works. It's like, I mean, it sounds a bit.
Tiny, but it was it was a lot of fun to make it. And then it was just recording with it. Like the guy was like, well, that actually sounds really good. And because all the band apart from you, you actually were like, well, that's really cool. Everyone in the band hated that. They were like, that's a stupid joke, why would you do that? But they weren't laughing when I told them we don't get free beer.
And then when brought to the studio and the producer was like, oh, that sounds great. It's like, no.
So it's that was a lot of fun, but like that's that was the second make phone that made for us as well, because I made one out of an old telephone speaker as well, because it's like speakers and microphones are essentially the same thing. It's just a heavy wire it. So I basically just drilled a few holes in an old guitar pedal box and then kind of glued it onto the back and it's the we call it the post ironic state Vox box. So we're talking about all these effects in the posterior next stage sound. So what about we just play one of your tracks?
Just talked about what the hell is going on.



Paler than that, but that's OK.
And I won't always be there.
And I can't promise I'll see the day, but I'll try.

You can call it off, I'll be all right.
And I won't always be in your side.
And I can be there every night, but I'll try.


What's for you on passing by? You know I never say goodbye to you. You don't have anything to prove to me and you wouldn't lie.



You go what the hell is going on post ironic state And while I was playing, I've been a bit tired and I apologize. There's been a number of messages coming and but I've yeah, I've kind of just overlooked them unfortunately, but I'm chasing through them. They are just now and one really of know is from John Lighthart comment on the Facebook page.
And he's actually asking you if you have any future dates planned. He could make the day earlier this year in Edinburgh he'd be talking about I guess anyway, you'd be talking about the single launch, which we'll talk about shortly, but.
So can you enlighten John, do you have, do you have any future dates planned? What? What's what's next for for the band? Yeah, I can see George are looking over at me. So yeah. No, it's we've got next month on the 18th of May, we are playing in Glasgow again and that's supporting the Preoccupations, which again, the kind of, I'd say quite similar test. If you like them, you'll probably like the Preoccupations as well.
So we're going to be supporting them at Room 2IN Glasgow on the 18th of May and that's all we've got in terms of announceable gigs. But with regards to kind of other songs and stuff, we will be doing quite a few. We've got at least 5 ready to release essentially. So you know, look out for them because we'll be doing single release parties for each of those ones as well. So we will be doing quite a few dates and potentially more, I'm not sure yet. We just need to kind of figure out there.
But aside from that, we are just recording and mixing our own stuff now, so we're quite busy with that. So not really got a lot of gigs on the books. But I was just thinking here, Renee, you're looking over at me. There was a time we were in Perth and there was like, Oh yeah, he's playing again anytime soon And you went, Jay, when is the next segment? We have gigs. And I just walked away because I couldn't think of anyone. Just got me a flashback.
No, I think we are just like really doing like more recording now, but I don't know. We'll see if any pop up like definitely. But I think I we've when was, well, I'm trying to think we're quite a big lull before Citadel where we didn't release anything and we just kind of did gigs. And I think, yeah, I think it would be better to just like get some stuff out. So I yeah, yeah. So I mean, that's great. Well, and it will just be a case of if you let me know, I'll I'll, I'll share the love.
Let everybody know. Thank you. Thank you. So as soon as I hear, I'll spread the word. And yeah, so just keep an eye on the page, John, and.
Yeah, who knows, We'll see, maybe real soon. The next gig. One thing and you're talking about your record and what have you. One thing, just a game of talking off Michael. That track was playing there. And actually, Jane from Musselburgh has said that she absolutely loved what the hell is going on. Thank you. Is great. Sorry, the message was trunk truncated. She's saying she loved what the hell is going on. It's absolutely great.
And I do too Well, that was actually playing. You did talk about some other works. You I mean, I know that you're really busy, but there's a charity, there's some charity work. Do you want to do you want to talk about that just before we go into the last song? Definitely. So there's I'll try to keep it quite brief just so that we can keep in mind with the times. But we are going to be playing in our Joy Division cover album for charity. It's run by so boring in Edinburgh band and they basically kind of put a notice saying, Hey, we're.
Bands, they want to be part of this album. You're going to be do enjoy the vision covers. Pick which one you want to do. We'll release it and then we'll do a gig in the back of it. So it's like us and 20 other bands. So you've got some really good heavy hitters in the scene. So you've got like Vacant Pavements, Comfort Girl. I'd like to say that we are one of the heavy hairs, but we'll wait and see. On Hallowed Ground. On Hallowed Ground as well. Absolutely. He let me hear what he's doing and it sounds fantastic.
So there's a lot going to be out and there's some like some of the kind of like bands that you wouldn't really expect to see in that lineup as well that are doing it. So I'm really excited to see their takes on some some iconic songs. But that's aiming to be out I believe in the next couple of months. Just also we're trying to we were originally going to try to stick to like the anniversary of of Ian Kurtz's passing, but unfortunately it was run by musicians so the time and didn't go to schedule at all. So I don't think anyone's actually done.
Apart from on hallowed ground.
We've got some work on it at least.
We just need to now record everything properly, but that will be out and we'll be doing a gig in Edinburgh essentially promote that and get the some some extra funds to don't need to charity as well. Sorry, that's brilliant. Not for a good cause to but listen, thank you so much. I mean, I really, really do mean I thank you so much. Thank you today. It's been it really has, it's been a privilege.
It seems quite fitting really. We've I've talked about the floor Tom's, the drumming and and all the rest of it. This song is kind of pivotable, pivotable, pivotal to to that that thing. I'm of course talking about your recent release Citadel. So seems quite apt to really play out with that. So like again, I want to thank you again for coming in and for those out there, appreciate because you are very, very, very, but you are very busy.
Lot information you just kind of threw by way gigs, releases, what have you. So I'll put together some show notes and collect the information that you can't share at the moment. I'll put that in there and put it out in the socials. And yeah, we'll keep in touch. As soon as I hear anything, I'll I'll, I'll be the first this year, that's for sure. Until then, this is a last song from post Ironic State. This is this is a single release back in January. It's called Citadel.





















When I saw you.
And the discs go.
Will you shock me?
You shining like gypsies.

Select find your minders like a snake if you read yourself around me as I feed you.

Come on me.







You're answering questions that have now.




Them all sparks will burnout in the end. Well be careful Angel. This life is just too long. All sparks whipping out in the end.
All spots will burn out. All spots will burn out. All spots will burnout.




Here you go 2 tracks here back-to-back just well Jay and JoJo were kind of just leaving the building when they were playing Citadel airport can't get my watch. I'm the best Star Trek. I don't mind seeing it really like I say I couldn't just can't emphasize enough him how good they are live They really and it's quite exciting to know that they've they've got some gigs kind of.
Kind of in the pipeline as it were. They can't reveal, excuse me, a couple of them just yet because I think, I suppose it's not quite dry. But they have shared some information with me and over the next couple of days I'll be putting together show notes and.
Putting the entire show up again so you can rinse and repeat as it were. You can listen to the show again or if if you've not listened to it well, you can listen to it for the for the first time. And it seems had a couple of messages coming in some people saying there's some problems with with.
Lady Cylinder, shall we say? I don't want to say the word, and then I can.
To trigger off some sort of home automation.
But yeah, so a lady selling dog beginning with a if you see a can you play this? It's not working. It seems there's some technical problems with tuning, but the hamsters are under their people and they're working through that. But it always not lost because if you're unable to catch a show, fire TuneIn, what have you. Like I say, I'll get the show up on to mix cloud.
Yes. We were just, well, I was kind of just seeing them out the door there really. We played 2 tracks back-to-back. That was the editors and all Sparks. And that was preceded by a track called well Girl from a band called, I think this is how you pronounce it, ZZZ. And it's stylized as a small Z, capital Z, small Z, so surely, surely ZZZ.
Anyway, I'm cursed. You check them out. That was lifted from their album. I've just dropped my show notes. Can you believe it? I'm all flustered. Just dropped my show notes there, but really encourage you to check them out. They are very, very good. As are they. As are these. These are the Dragons.

















By the Dragons that was trust and while that was playing there, I'm actually, I've been I've not been the best actually.
Manning the all the text messages and what have you. But so I'm kind of going through them. There has been absolutely a flurry. I think I was just so caught up in the moment interviewing Jay and JoJo, but a John Lighthart has chained them and I think the ship might have sailed actually, when he's saying a suggestion.
For the post ironic, see post Ironic state was to cover Joy Divisions.
Says you got to do isolation. Great keyboards, vocals and a fabulous tune from closer. So yeah. So there you go post ironic state if you're listening. There you go. I had a request and we've had a couple other messages saying that the lady cylinders not working too well. But fear no, of course I'll be lost in you because you won't be able hear this. But like I said just before I played that Dragons track that I will be uploading the show to to mix cloud over the next.
So with the opportunity to listen to it for the first time, I suppose if you're having problems during tonight. Now while we're off Mike there, one of the other tracks that were kind of influential part and to the post ironic state sound, if you like was a chameleons in a track called Swamp Thing. So looking at the time, we've got time to kind of squeeze that in. So like I say, the chameleons and Swamp Thing.







I can already hear you calling me to cross the room when the world and his wife are on my back again. Not enough pleasure.
Too much pain. When the world is too much with me, it's me. I just go away. I lose my mind completely. It's late. I just got out in the side street. Something's moving. Look around. Look around. Look around. All around you walls are tumbling down. Stop staring at the ground.
I can practically see your face.
And the normal revolutionary balls embrace. Hear the Thunder in your brain.
No, no, no.

When the demons knocking on your door, you're still staring down at the floor.
Not too many us from this hour.
So long.
The state comes. Or is it just another show?
Picking up the pieces.
Hop alive and 9:00 to 5:00 fake eyes.
Is it any wonder?
Where I'm a scream at the tease me scream, close your eyes.
Now the world is too much with me this way I just go away or lose my mind completely. I just leave. At least go now. Now I'm looking sacred anymore.
When the demons breaking down your door, you'll step down the floor.
Not too many eyes from this hour. So long, so long.
The stone comes. Or is it just another shower?
Not too many hours from this hour.



Come to my love land, wander along.
Beautiful garden.
To the sunshine, beaches and sand.
Isn't too blue face when you call my leg? The grass is mellow and the sky is blue.
My paradise is waiting for you.
Oh, it's a tropical love day.
Oh, I want to share it with you.
Lot can be funny.
Happy and sunny.
Boo in my tropical lovely.
Hanging.
Palm to my lovely.



Happy and sunny.
I want to show you.

I want to share with you.
With the B side of Mamma Mia, that was ABBA and Tropical Loveland actually appeared. It surfaced in a lot of incarnations, a lot of besides, and I think it appeared originally on the ABBA album.
Anyway, I'm just conscious of the time. Just a few minutes to go, time to shoehorn.
But just before I do, I just like to thank once again Jay and JoJo for saying by the studio and coming in, you know, it really was a really, really enjoyed myself there tonight and hope you did too. And kind of apologize really for not really getting to bit tardy really on the on the message in front, but must do better next week. And on that note, I will be back next week.
I really, really have missed, missed this place. It's great to be back. Yeah. So on that note, it seems fine to have a maybe not have a studio sit down. We'll have a planetary sit in. This is Julianne Cope.
I work on certain hot deserted streets of rain. You know, I'll travel till I found you. But I don't know where I went. So I watched the suicide of this Old Town. You know this way of life is killing us. It's time that we sat down And now every girl has your name.
Every girl has your name.
Every girl has your name.
Until they turn around.
I tie you up to tie you down, but I can't tie you down. Your spirit never weakens and you catch me. Catch me in the cloud of loving. Got a wall in 90° on a trip. Piece of light that I'm admitting. Time for a planet to be sitting.
'Cause every girl has your name.
Every girl has your name.
Every girl.
That's your name.
Until they turn around.
I see pictures of you, my dear, but it doesn't bring me any cheese.
Behold the goddess, luminous as you. Or shiny, shiny, shiny, shining.
And so I speak to the lovers of the world, the one soul. They fall in love and change the scene. Guess what they do? They organize the whole thing, resolving to sing with how they recognize that we're a minute.
