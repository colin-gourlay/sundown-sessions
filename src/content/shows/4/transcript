Well, good evening and welcome. My name is Colin Gurley and you're listening to the Sundown Sessions live on K107.
and what better way to open the show with Paul McCartney and that was a
Smell Away that was actually the last track on the album Ram released back in
May 1971 and for those with with a decent memory they might recall that
that cover featured Paul McCartney holding a Ram and Lennon a few years
later followed that up with it with the original pressing of the Imagine album
it came with what became known as Lennon's pig postcard and it depicted
John Fondlin pig's ears yeah it's a little bit sad how things panned out but
anyway we are here for happy tunes and happy thoughts so not going to dwell on
that too much longer and for those wondering why I want to open the show
with Paul McCartney you if you listened last week you will no doubt recall that
I was just slightly excited about the fact that my wife had secured tickets to
go and see Paul down down in Manchester later this year and bless her I am the
Beatles fan and I had no idea about it but after the back of watching Get Back
which Disney was running some time ago she herself was quite impressed so at
the back of that she signed up to the Paul McCartney fan club and was getting
notifications about when he was playing and where so I'm terribly grateful she
did because she managed to get pre-sale tickets for that event and then she
come and running through literally as I was coming out the door to come down to
the station last week telling me the great news and you know the time I got
to the station I was I was still shaking really was and and I guess I guess to an
extent I certainly am I mean there is absolutely nobody that's more pumped up
than I
Oh
Well sooner than I say I can't get any more worked up about that then
while that song was playing Collette who's a she's still hanging around the
studio she's just packing up she's telling me that she went to see Paul
McCartney 2011 I think it was 2011 she just walked out the door and so I can't
check but yeah she was she was telling me that I should be really really
excited and indeed I am anyway moving on to now that I've got this Beatles thing
out my system moving on to a band that was really into really at the back of I
have to say this very slowly she sells sanctuary when I saw that first first
time this was a lead single by the cult and from the album love and yeah it's
just it's ended up turning into a bit of an anthem but I was blown away by that
by that record and I asked it so that the album came out 18th October 1985 and
you know I wrote a letter to Santa asking asking if I could get a copy of
that and well we had big stockings back in it back in that day but I was I was
really really delighted that it came my way so I must have been a good boy that
year this is the cult
when the music began
not all around
when the music is out
every day
we are part of
always this way
yeah
every day
we are part of
always this way
when I kick my girls
or cheat girls and girls
or have them to sit
around
I don't think
there's an easy way out of here
but when the music is out
we are part of

and Mark Buzeski the drummer from Big Country played on every other track on
that album and I can definitely hear his styles the way he kind of does what he
does on the Tom Toms. But what I thought was really interesting about that is
that although Mark Buzeski played drums on every single track and the one track
that Nigel Preston did play on, Mark Buzeski stepped in and on the video
She Sells Sanctuary they just threw a leather jacket on him just to make it
look like he'd fitted in because he didn't come up for the video shoot that
day and he performed drums on that. Anyway around about that time I mean
after I got that album I was I was hook, line, and sinker I was a massive massive
fan in fact and I saw them saw them many times actually while that record was
playing Clet come darting in the door saying haha she's seen them too and I'm
like well yeah I can see I've seen them. I've actually seen them a few times once
once one that sticks in my mind was back in the March the 5th 1987 and March the
5th that's a quite significant date for me that's perhaps a story for another
day but a band that was supporting them on that that particular evening that was
a part of the electric tour was a band called Gay Bikers on the Acid and they
were I'm saying they were part of they were probably responsible for what
became known as the very short-lived greeble scene you need to Google what
that actually means I've no idea but I do that title sticks for some reason and
yeah I was really I was quite taken by them so I again I started I was just at
the age where I was in my teens I was just basically spending all my money on
records and at the time they were depending were touring with the cult
they were promoting their single everything's groovy I thought a bit
obvious to go and pay that but I've actually opted for the the follow-up
single to that it was also released on in tape it was before Virgin snapped them
up and it really didn't come to anything I thought it would but there was so much
promotion behind them when they released the album it was just gimmicky
things about well the album was called drill your own hole and it was the
first 10,000 copies had no center hole and you know and the vinyl LP but with
all these gimmicks it just they just didn't seem to convert into sales and
yeah the gay bikers sadly no more this is a Nose Dive Karma
yeah
I was in greed. Nostalgia through your veins. It ain't crap that I need. To make things seem the same.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

My goodness, if you thought that song was hectic, you wouldn't have been in the studio while that was playing, there was just an absolute flurry of activity, which actually serves as a bit of a prompt, first of all.
I think I should give out the studio text number in case you want to say what you're enjoying or just let me know that I'm not speaking to a void.
You can text me on 07723 58 1687 and really what served as a bit of prompt was Dave Hamilton has just sent a message and saying love the cult good wee show and I actually heard a text from got a very special guest who I'm seeing who was on his way.
He's now getting settled but he was just texting me to let me know he was at the door so I'm just going to let him get settled just after these adverts.

EcoBean Coffee Bar in the heart of the Mercat Shopping Centre Kirkcaldy is about to give your taste buds a jolt.
EcoBean is not just about hand selected coffees from the finest growers in the world, they're also brewing up a storm with their new light bites menu.
Get ready to tuck into some tasty toasties, satisfying sandwiches, authentic Belgian waffles, fresh soups and homemade scones.
It's time to experience more than coffee at the EcoBean Coffee Bar, they're waiting to serve you Monday to Saturday from 10am.
So I'd rather stay in Kirkcaldy and why not? Why not? Well I thought I'd cheek things up a little bit this week and give David Latow a little bit of a rest and play the original.
The original, the one that I'm probably more familiar with and that was by the Alexander Brothers.
And the familiarity really stems from a time when I would stand in the family enclosure with my dad, my grandad, my uncles.
In fact the whole Gurley clan was out there in the family enclosure and that was, you could hear that song.
Week in, week out I was adopted by all the fans in the terraces.
And it's a rather tenuous link but Wraith Rovers Football Club have played a part in the recovery of Kenny Armour who happens to be my very, very special guest.
I'm absolutely thrilled to say that Kenny Armour from Andy's Man Club is joining me this evening. So welcome Kenny.
Thank you very much for having me along tonight, it's a pleasure to join you.
It's absolutely my pleasure. So for the listeners out there who may not know or may not even have heard of Andy's Man Club, can you tell us a little bit about what Andy's Man Club is?
Yeah so as you say Wraith Rovers are a massive part of my recovery and Andy's Man Club is the other part of it.
So Andy's Man Club is a peer to peer support group for men, basically having a safe space for men to come in and talk, get things off their chest.
Sadly it was set up in 2016 on the back of a suicide so Andy Roberts, 23 year old, took his own life and then from there they created this peer to peer support group which is much more than mental health, it's that social side now.
And we're very lucky in Kirkcaldy that we've got one at Starts Park which meet every Monday night.
Yeah and of course you're saying it was back all those years ago, it has been, the growth has been quite organic but more recently there's, which is obviously a good thing, Richard Gervais has tweeted, it's been in Sky News and more recently Robbie Williams tweeted.
So all that exposure and raising awareness is quite something else and of course the library and some trains are being decorated.
In fact, correct me if I'm wrong, I think Andy's mum was somehow involved in the launch of that.
Yeah she was, she was along, she still plays a big part in day to day life with Andy's Man Club obviously, raising that awareness and getting more involved.
Inside Council is probably another prime example, local to us has got one of the bin lorries in each area, so they've got one in Glenrothes, Cooper and Dunfermline with the sign writing on the side of it which is massive and we're going to be doing a lot more so a bit more local to us as well.
And ScotRail, we're probably, I maybe shouldn't be saying this live on air but just next week we'll be doing a launch of a partnership with ScotRail as well so it's exciting times ahead.
Well there you go, you heard it first, live on K107, here's a wee exclusive for you. I mean that's terrific, you're saying that, tracking back a little bit, so there's a lot of kind of local events but it is actually a national organisation.
It all started just with like, you know, a gathering with 10 people and you know, what sort of numbers are we at now?
Yes, as you say, 2016 was, the first night it was nine men walked through the door then it went to 15 and from there it's grown massively.
We're coming into the 4th of July, it will be eight years since the first group was ever held and we now have over 4,500 men every week walking through the doors.
I believe around about 800 in Scotland just now, we've got 42 clubs in Scotland itself and lucky enough in Fife we've got 13 clubs throughout Fife area as well.
So locally presence is massive but nationally it's huge as well and just given that awareness and just getting men talking, having that safe space.
I mean it is really incredible how it's grown. So as part of the introduction there, I said Andy's, Kenny from Andy's Man Club, I didn't actually say in what capacity you are involved with, I mean, do you want to talk a little bit about that, what you do now?
Yeah, as you say, the recovery was massive so I used Andy's Man Club first and foremost for myself when it opened at Stats Park and then become a volunteer with the charity and now luckily and privileged to be honest, I now work full time for the charity as an area lead.
So my role is going to be slightly changing in the coming months but more focusing on Fife area and so just looking after the clubs, helping expand, grow, raise awareness and just make sure the volunteers themselves are well looked after and make sure they've got everything they need to flourish more than anything.
What clubs in Fife are up and running at the moment?
Yeah, so we've got King Carden, we've got two in Dunfermline, we're in Recythe, Dalgety Bay, we are in Cowdenbeef, Kelty, we're in St Andrews, Cooper, two in Glenrothes and we're in Methil and obviously the heart of Fife, we're in Kirkcaldy as well at Stats Park.
So yeah, 13 clubs and we're looking to expand as well so hopefully have a few more clubs come in in the near future as well.
That's brilliant. So anybody listening there who is maybe thinking about coming along theirself or they maybe know somebody who they would like to kind of point in the direction, are you able to talk a little bit about what a given, I was going to say a Monday night, it's not every Monday night is it?
Yeah, so no, we meet every Monday night at 7pm, except from bank holidays so obviously due to bank holidays our venues are majority of the time given to us free of charge so we do have some bank holidays that we shut but every Monday night at 7pm and it's a safe space for men to come in and talk so as long as you're over the age of 18, you're identified as a male, you're welcome to come through the Doors Andy's Man Club and it's just creating that safe space to come in, get things off your chest.
And as much as it was set up on the back of a suicide and mental health, we're there for any man so even just the social side, if it's to get out of the house and have that tea, coffee, biscuit, have the conversations with like minded people, that's what it's all about.
We have some people, I know in the Dunfermline group we have an 80 year old who comes in just for the social side, just have the conversations every week with friends now more than anything, they walk in as strangers but they become friends and it's a massive part of the social side as well, just getting out of the house.
Yeah and I think that's quite an important point you make actually, you don't have to be at that point, a kind of crisis point if you will, it is just for people getting things off their chest and I guess hopefully leaving the place in a better frame of mind than they did when they came in.
So what is a kind of secret sauce then? I mean what does a given Monday look like in a club? So somebody, I'd imagine for some people that might be quite a daunting experience to what goes on inside and just taking that step over the door.
So are you able to talk a little bit about what kind of happens inside on a night so if anybody is thinking about coming across they know what to expect?
Yeah, no definitely one of the hardest steps is getting through that door the first night. So every club you'll be welcomed just outside the main area of the venue with a welcome face by somebody wearing an Andes Man Club top there, the volunteers that are going to run that session, they're going to take you into the venue.
They're going to take you into the venue so we'll use Kirkcaldy as an example, sunny starts park, you're walking up on a Monday night up the main ramp to the main reception area and that's where you'll be welcomed.
You'll get taken into the hospitality suite just upstairs, we'll sit in a circle of chairs basically, so we'll sit out in a circle of chairs, normally try and keep the group size around about the 15 mark if we can.
If there's slightly more we'll sometimes split into two groups just to accommodate so people are getting that safe space but come 7 o'clock we get cracked on with the meeting.
We've got certain rules we go over, we don't talk about religion, politics, medication and criminal matters, other than that it's a safe space to open up and talk and get things off your chest.
We sit in a circle of chairs, we pass a ball around, when you've got that ball it's your turn to talk.
We ask five questions so as I say it's not designed around the mental health side of things, it's just designed around getting men talking.
As you know we're very good at not talking so it's trying to give people that safe space to talk so part of the five questions is the first three questions always stay the same.
So we'll ask how's your week been, we'll then ask positive from your week and then we'll ask anything to get off your chest so that's your chance to open up, share, get the things off your chest.
May it be small things, may it be big things, it doesn't really matter as much as the important bit is getting that bit off your chest.
I know for me sometimes I've got two young kids so just the stresses of having the kids is sometimes enough to get off their chest.
It could be that your car's broken down and anything that's affecting you that week it's good to get off your chest.
I know this week coming for example I've just completed the Yorkshire free peek so I'll be sharing about how anything off my chest is just my sore legs more than anything.
So as much as it's a little thing it's what's bothering me this week but then after that with question three it can be quite difficult.
We've got some hard shares in there and it is hard some weeks but we'll have a little break and a regroup basically to make sure everyone is good.
And then we go into questions four and five and they're really just the light hearted questions.
Question four is kind of designed around positivity, focusing on going forward and goal setting.
And question five is just based on a quick fire, light hearted, most important bit as you say at the beginning there was you're leaving on a high more than anything.
And yeah just getting that safe space to open up and talk so that's pretty much an Andes man club as a whole.
And as I say we're now currently have over 4500 men with nearly 200 groups.
The middle of July we'll be into 200 groups nationwide and we also have an online group as well.
So for people who struggle socially and maybe not get out of their house or people who don't live near a group we can use the online platform as well.
Yeah that's amazing and I guess just tracking back a little bit to what you're saying about the power of the ball.
Correct me if I'm wrong I think if I picked you up rightly there's a peer to peer support network.
So it's basically when somebody has a ball it's their moment to get they can share as much as they want or as little as they want.
They can share nothing if they don't feel ready they just want to kind of come along and see what it's all about.
But I guess that could at times be proof cathartic in a way just sometimes even just verbalizing something.
You know people may not have the answers but just actually because we are bad.
Yeah we're very bad at it. We're getting better slightly but yeah as you say the ball is used to get the things off your chest.
And it might take a couple of weeks so there's absolutely no pressure to talk.
You can pass the ball around and I think personally speaking listening to other people talking and getting things off your chest has helped me massively.
It's gave me things of I'm actually going through that as well and it might not be anything to get off your chest.
You can just maybe say I completely agree with you I relate to you I know how you feel.
And sometimes that's more powerful than actually sharing.
That's right yeah and it kind of validates maybe your mindset at that time.
I completely understand that.
There's something else you said as well that you know we're talking about the groups about 15.
Nobody would be turned away if you know well I'm kind of stating I'm asking the question.
You know somebody wanted to rock up on Monday night do they need to be self-referred?
Yeah so it's completely as I say the groups are completely free.
There's no bookings involved there's no referral involved it's just a case of turning up on a Monday night.
What we ask if people can get there for around about quarter to ten to seven as I say the meeting starts at seven o'clock.
But it's just a case of turning up to the venues.
All that information can be found on the website andyismanclub.co.uk.
You can put your postcode and you can see where your nearest group is and yeah it's just a case of turning up.
As long as you identify as a male you're over the age of 18 you'll be welcomed into the group and that's there to use.
Even if it is for the first few weeks that you're not sharing it's just important that you're in that room.
And having the opportunity to share.
I mean that sounds really good.
Getting to go into Starks Park getting a free cup of tea and a free biscuit you know what's not to like.
Actually on that note about free cups of tea and stuff if you're able to share this how's Andy's Man Club actually funded?
Yeah so it's obviously it was a personal thing to begin with and one of the things was we wanted to keep it as free as possible.
So breaking the barriers down so boys can come in and they don't have to have a charge involved.
So we're very lucky we've got a lot of donations coming through venues getting donated to us free of charge.
We've got teas and coffees donated to us but we are purely donation based so we rely heavily on donations.
Part of my job is to go around and do presentations and work around companies which receive good donations that way which is amazing.
But this year we've also started doing our own events as well so we've got a couple of running events.
We recently done a fire walk in Glenrothes which was a powerful night and it got raised a lot of money for us as well.
But most importantly raising awareness is the biggest bit.
But as I say we've just done the Yorkshire Free Peaks on Saturday and my legs are still sore a few days on.
And most of that was people raising money for us but at the same time raising awareness for us.
If you've got over 200 people walking the Yorkshire Free Peaks shouting about on social media it's massive.
We've got a couple of running events coming up which is raising good money for us as well.
And all that is going back into the clubs to help more men walk through the door.
That's brilliant. So when the adverts were on there earlier when we were just meeting Kerry we were coming up the stairs.
When I told him that the studio was upstairs his face said it all and then he was taking it.
So I happened to know a little bit about the Free Peaks challenge and your race and that.
So that's terrific work. So the information about those running challenges that you mentioned there.
So the Delamere, you said you're doing the Great North Front, the Haldane Forest as well, is that right?
Yes that's right. So we've got the three of them booked in.
So the Delamere Forest is coming up on the 14th of July I believe it is, Sunday.
And we've got a 2k fundraise for the kids in that event.
We've also got a 10k race and we're also doing a half marathon.
On the back of that we've got the Great North Run on the 8th of September.
Which we've managed to secure over 300 places for and we've got a further 80 people running on behalf of Andy's Man Club.
So I know personally I've been raising money for it and it's been a massive help for my training plan to do it.
I'm not the fittest as Colin's realised when I'm walking up those stairs and I'm in agony after just doing a couple of hills.
But yeah, training for that, raising the money.
Then we've got the Haldane Forest at the end of September as well which is a 10k race.
I feel like I should just jump in there. I didn't say you were not the fittest.
Not the fittest, I mean anybody who does a marathon distance, the stairs are never going to be your friend.
It doesn't matter how fit or unfit you are.
But what an achievement that is, it's quite an achievement.
With regards to, there was quite a lot of information there.
So before you go, before you leave the building, I'll get all that information out of you and then I'll put it on the Sunday In Sessions website.
So if anybody's interested in perhaps finding out more, they just want to take part in the race or I'll get a link to you for these events that you're doing.
You maybe want to sponsor Kenny yourself or of course if you're keen to find out more about Andy's Man Club I'll put links on to the site.
But I mean they should be easy enough to find.
They're all across all the socials, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook or X as it's now known.
Facebook, of course the website and what have you.
So you just type in Andy's Man Club in Google and you'll find it.
I just want to thank you again Kenny for coming in.
It really is. It's sad in a lot of ways that you've got so many groups and so many people coming.
But I'd flip that around. Actually it's a positive that more and more people are, more and more men rather, are finding within themselves to kind of step through that door which has got to be the hardest thing to do.
I think once you're through that door I'm reasonably confident you're bowing down what on earth was all the fuss about.
But just making that first step so it's easy to think oh those numbers they're quite high but the higher the better in my book.
The more people that are talking. So I don't know before we wrap up Kenny have you got anything more you want to add?
Just thank you very much for having me along and if there is anybody out there listening who's maybe going through a struggle their self or know anybody then just reach out.
Maybe a friend, a family member, just speak to them and have conversations.
I know the power of talking is massive. One thing I will do and it's maybe something that you can benefit from your radio show is question five is a quick fire one we use.
It's your guilty pleasure song is one of my favourite ones and I'm not afraid to admit that I do like a bit of Westlife and it's a kind of past one.
So for any listeners out there it's what is your guilty pleasure song? Let's text it in and get Colin playing it possibly next week.
Thank you very much for having me along it's been a pleasure.
Thanks very much Kenny. Listen it would be great to you know in a few months time it would be great to actually have you back in.
I'd love to hear more about how things are going with Andy's Man Club and hopefully the continued growth and more clubs and more men.
Hopefully this gets out and reaches that one man and let's keep on talking.
Touch my heart,
Help me close,
You were always there by my side,
Night and day,
Through it all,
Baby come what may,
Swept away on a wave of emotion,
I were caught in the eye of the storm,
And whenever you smile I can hardly believe that you're mine,
Believe that you're mine,
This love is unbreakable,
It's unmistakable,
And each time I look in your eyes,
I know why,
This love is untouchable,
I feel that my heart just can't deny,
Each time I look in your eyes,
Oh baby I know why,
This love is unbreakable,
Share the laughter,
Share the tears,
We both know,
We'll go on from here,
Cause together,
We are strong,
In my arms,
That's where you'll be alone,
I've been touched by the hands of an angel,
I've been blessed by the power of love,
And whenever you smile I can hardly believe that you're mine,
This love is unbreakable,
It's unmistakable,
And each time I look in your eyes,
I know why,
This love is untouchable,
I feel that my heart just can't deny,
Each time you whisper my name,
Oh baby I know why,
This love is unbreakable,
Fire and flame,
When all this is over,
Our love still remains,
This love is unbreakable,
It's unmistakable,
Each time I look in your eyes,
I know why,
This love is untouchable,
I feel that my heart just can't deny,
Each time you whisper my name,
Oh baby I know why,
Each time I look in your eyes,
Oh baby I know why,
This love is unbreakable,
There you go, that was Westlife and Unbreakable.
And it probably appears in the interviewer's handbook,
So one guide, always vet your guests in the future,
In case they have such guilty pleasures,
I can assure you, that will be the first and last time
That Westlife will ever feature on this show.
But you know, I decided to bend or break my own rule,
Because my wife Deborah, she secured me tickets for Paul McCartney,
And that song featured in her wedding,
Yeah, so I'm a big softie deep down.
But you know, save Kenny's blushes,
I don't think Alex McIntlock or Mark Ingalls should get away lightly either,
So just for context,
Alex McIntlock is the head of groups in Scotland for Andy's Man Club,
And he's revealed that his guilty pleasures is Starships by Nicki Minaj,
And it gets better yet,
Mark Ingalls, who's also an area lead,
This is Barbie Girl by Aqua,
So yeah, I'll keep that in the back of my mind,
Always vet your guests.
Ouch, it's the first thing I pack now.
In an emergency at the coast, call 999 and ask for the Coast Guard,
And please, respect the water.

Suffocate me with kisses baby,
Suffocate me with a burning love,
Suffocate me, put your chains around me,
Suffocate me, I'm thirsted up.
Suffocate me with conversation,
Suffocate me with unsaid words,
Suffocate me with indecision,
Suffocate me with who comes first.
I love you, you're so religious,
I get a thrill when the curtain calls,
I feel like a Roman candle,
Do your stuff while the Empire falls.
Suffocate me.
Music
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you,
I love you, you know I do.
Suffocate me, suffocate me,
Suffocate me, suffocate me,
Suffocate me, suffocate me,
Suffocate me, suffocate me,
Suffocate me, suffocate me,
Suffocate me, suffocate me,
Suffocate me, suffocate me,
Suffocate me.
there was ever a record that demonstrated that being at the right place at the right time
can be quite important, you've just listened to it. That was Angel Fish and a track called
Suffocate Me from the album Angel Fish released back in 1994 and that was famously aired just the
once during a late night show on MTV. I think the show was called 120 Minutes but crucially
it was only ever played once and it just so happened that a chap called Steve Marker
who was a co-founder of Garbage caught that and invited Manson to join the band.
Of course I'm saying of course you may or may not know this the Angel Fish was actually a side
project by a band Goodbye Mr Mackenzie and up until that point certainly Goodbye Mr Mackenzie
was Martin Metcalf that took lead vocals and surely up to that point she did provide on some
tracks particularly some of the album tracks it was more backing vocals and keyboards and
she did play guitar occasionally as well. So I think it'd be a bit obvious to play
Garbage but we'll have no garbage on this so let's go for Goodbye Mr Mackenzie instead.
This is Normal Boy.
This is Normal Boy.
I believe in pain who doesn't always want to do it again
who is addicted to Australian soaps a girl that doesn't tell filthy jokes
That was Normal Boy released from the album 5 and we'll have more of Goodbye Mr Mackenzie
shortly so Finn Wilson and Martin Metcalf are actually they're touring with the skids
I'm saying touring they're actually playing with the skids at the moment and we might just have a
chance to shoehorn this in just ahead in the news it'll be maybe less than a minute but we'll we'll
see where we get

you
oops um press the wrong button there okay just two more mate and uh
okay yes that was the news and this is goodbye Mr Mackenzie
oh
well I'm going down to the 40 cell to recover you I might as well I've seen you dumb
and I've seen you smart and I saw you rocking the apple cart now you're making it hard
you're making it harder now harder now you're making it hard
harder
he used to make things so easy
he used to make things so easy
he used to make things so easy
he used to make it easy now you're making it hard
oh
well I've seen you dumb and I've seen you smart and I saw you blow up
the apple cart
ego after that false start that was goodbye goodbye Mr Mackenzie
and hard and before the news I tried I tried very hard to shoe shoe horn a skids track
from from the album days in Europa it was charade and just really on that note like
Finn Wilson as I said uh Mark Metcalfe they're actually now playing with the skids uh Bruce
Watson and Jamie Watson originally from big country of course um their commitments to big
country were kind of getting pressing so it left the skids um in need of a bass player and
a guitarist and of course Martin Metcalfe has done a lot of work with Richard Jobson
over the years working on a soundtrack and to film what have you so it seemed an obvious natural fit
and Martin himself is um has never been backward and forward and saying that he's been a long time
fan of the skid so he's it's obviously important to him and I picked that particular track just
because the euro's going on I thought yeah we'll just go for something off days in Europa and I
didn't realize at the time actually I mean I've got that was a vinyl version um sorry vinyl
version that was a track from my own vinyl album and I was just curious because I know that the
album I have it since been withdrawn because the cover um yeah it's probably not really safe
to say but basically the album cover I have it was just drawn and uh if you have the particular
one that I have um with uh shall we just say with the the Olympian on the front um hold on to it
because I checked in the record collector's rare rare price guide and uh it's worth a few bobs so
I mean not that I'll ever part with it but um it's just nice to know I'm sitting on a wee
wee treasure chest so that was before the news um I think you maybe got a couple of bars of that
at a push um and we followed that up with uh the second goodbye mr mckenzie track of the evening
and that was hard and I was absolutely delighted to hear although I've just said that they have
commitments with skids at the moment um when that's all wrapped up they are going to be
playing as goodbye mr mcken goodbye mr mckenzie slash the filthy tongues um they're juggling
quite a few bands at the same time um but there's a couple of goodbye mr mckenzie gigs lined up
because they've um I'm saying up to now still still at this moment in time uh the album five
is not available for download or any of the streaming platforms which uh you know I'm not
here nor there about it I have my own copy but um they're actually remastering reissuing it um
and you know the the variety uh color vinyls it's coming um so I'm looking forward to that um
because a couple of years back when they done some anniversary gigs off their first album
good deeds and dirty rags uh that was remastered and uh whoever was whoever was behind the
remastered and done an absolutely sterling job uh was really good so I'm looking forward to that
when it comes out I believe it's later on this year but uh as soon as I hear I'll be the first
to share it on this show uh they're a band really that that album hard and for that matter the one
before uh normal boy it's quite far removed from their the first few albums and uh I remember big
john duncan in an interview saying that um they were really hoping that this album captured
what they sounded like live and I I'm inclined to actually agree with that um
uh I think that could be the last time I saw them certainly the last time I saw them when
Shirley Manson was playing with them when it was the full output uh john duncan finn wilson
mccaff kelly on drums um they they were just absolutely phenomenal and that was just across
the road actually in the adam smith center uh the year absolutely escapes me but um that was a
phenomenal gig and uh that was the opening track of that set actually I just remember
finn wilson coming on playing that that really hard bass it just seemed to go on forever and then
the fog I mean you could literally not see there was so much fog going on
john duncan came on and you know there's coming on one at a time but the one thing that really
sticks in my mind about that it's really really odd um well maybe if you play the guitar you
might understand where I'm coming from um uh yep sorry um I was a bit distracted by some mouse
movement going on there um so uh where was I sorry I've lost lost my train of thought um
yeah the one thing that really sticks in my mind that's it yeah um being a guitar player um I'm
known to have a bit of guitar envy and I remember quite distinctly Shirley Manson playing a blue
rickenbacker and why it really sticks in my mind because it was an unusual shape um it's not um
yeah it was just an unusual but I don't want to kind of go into the whole anirachy thing
about guitars because uh I think I might lose a few listeners if I haven't already done so
I think the point I'm trying to make is it's just as funny the things you remember
and actually on that note um I took uh took a run up to see my gig buddy well I'm seeing my gig
buddy he's actually he's a very very good friend it's uh we go to a lot of gigs together and he
works up at Perth kitchen center and they've they've recently moved premises so I went up to
see him it was long overdue and it was on the way back um I don't know how I managed it I somehow
took a wrong turn and went past the Perth city hall and a whole lot of really happy memories
came back but without much further ado we'll play the track that this
this really just evoked those memories this is Hipsway
Back
Outside the hotel
On the balcony
Hands on the railing

That was Hipsway and a track called Tinder from the album Hipsway
Released back in 1986, if I remember rightly
You know, whether I've got the year right or wrong, those of a certain age will, I'm absolutely certain, will remember that
Because it featured really heavily on the McEwan's Lager adverts
And that indeed was the one with the train stations
Now I know, I know, I know, certainly if you were in my circles, if you're listening to this you'll be screaming at the radio
You're not interested in that one, you want the one where we're pushing the stones up the hill
Well, sit back and relax, I've got you sorted
That was Hipsway and a track called Tinder from the album Hipsway
Released back in 1986, if I remember rightly
You know, whether I've got the year right or wrong, those of a certain age will, I'm absolutely certain, will remember that
Because it featured really heavily on the McEwan's Lager adverts
And that indeed was the one with the train stations
Ah, ah, ah, ah
It's a crazy chain that cuts the drug

Soft and scared and troubled, ugly

That was when, and you've got the power
It was released, it appeared on the album rather
A Tears Baby, a Trash Icon
And prior to that it had actually been released
Re-released and re-re-released
And to this day I'm still scratching my head
Trying to understand why that single was never hit
At the final time of asking
Cadbury's Flake were sponsoring
Sponsoring that leaf just because the front cover
Featured a baby hold on a flake
I'm not really quite sure what the significance of all that
Or the relationship rather was
Because it was an anti-heroin song
So Cadbury's were sponsoring it
They were fronted by Davey Henderson
Who formerly of the Fire Engines
So there's naturally a bit of interest around him himself
And I remember quite vividly
I was at a record fair
I don't know if they still run them
In the assembly rooms in Edinburgh
After going to a record fair
I went into, because I hadn't splurged enough money
I went into, it could have been HMV or Virgin
I can't quite remember
The two shops were right next to each other on Princess Street
But I remember coming down the elevator
And it was floor to ceiling
It was copies, 12 inch copies
Of when you got the power
I know myself
I've got at least half a dozen copies
You know, the gatefold
The gatefold 7 inch, the double pack
Just the way they did all the packaging back then
To try and increase the numbers
But my copies it seems weren't quite enough
Yeah, on top of that I missed
I missed probably the biggest kind of connection
After Tinder and Hipsway
It was heavily featured on the McEwen's Lager advert
And of course I made reference to the one
Pushing the stones up the hill
But despite all that
It didn't come to anything
Anyway, by way of balance
I don't know how many times I've mentioned McEwen's Lager
Just as part of that story
Like everything, everything's okay in moderation
This next song is by a Glasgow band
The harmonies on this
Towards the end, I'm not wishing the song away
But please just listen
Pay attention to the harmonies at the end
They're just quite something else
This is called The Dirty Thirst
The ocean can lead to inspiration
But tonight I'm just another
Guy without a mother
Servicing this dirty thirst
I don't want to wipe
All traces
What feels good tonight
Will feel bad in the morning light
I got wasted
I'm not strong enough
To resist my dirty thirst
These faces
Don't seem right
Keeping it together
With dreams as wild as ever
No need to be nervous
The drink will cure the scaredness
There's no room here for dignity
Now we say we're leaving
I'm turned on by the feeling
Gonna touch you up
Fill my dirty cup
The night is made a mess of me
I don't want to wipe
All traces
What feels good tonight
Will feel bad in the morning light
I got wasted
I'm not strong enough
To resist my dirty thirst
These faces
Don't seem right
Don't seem right
I don't want to wipe
All traces
What feels good tonight
Will feel bad in the morning light
I got wasted
I'm not strong enough
To resist
I don't want to wipe
All traces
What feels good tonight
Will feel bad in the morning light
I got wasted
I'm not strong enough
To resist
I don't want to wipe
All traces
What feels good tonight
Will feel bad in the morning light
I got wasted
I'm not strong enough
To resist
I don't want to wipe
These faces
Don't seem right

But don't give in
If you should climb to the top of the world
Just to take it all but shit
Why would it matter if the world seemed to shatter
Is it the world you believe in?
You crawl to the ends of the earth
As the sea breeze caving in
Our knees put back right
All the seas unwrapped
All the reason for living
With flesh and blood and small shame
We start a little something new
Rather lead and be mistaken
Than following and faking
For the sake of seeming true
All the stars and the satellite shine down on you
But which will you heed?
If you should climb to the top of the world
Just to take it all but shit
Why would it matter if the world seemed to shatter
Is it the world you believe in?
You crawl to the ends of the earth
As the sea breeze caving in
Our knees put back right
All the seas unwrapped
All the reason for living
In fact you've drowned in the light of your eyes
I'd rather die giving
Wipe the light with some grace
And say what in a race
Ain't that a reason for living
That, in my opinion, is a perfect pop record.
It really is.
From the album, The North Star, that was Roddy Fraym, of course, formerly off Astate Camera.
That song was called Reason for Living.
It was a single but it just didn't even make a dent in the charts.
Yeah, astonishing.
Anyway, I'm conscious that I have been playing.
It's not deliberate, it's just been a happy coincidence.
I've been playing a number of back-to-back Scottish tracks.
So I think it's probably time to redress that balance.
And really, if you care to correct me, my Welsh isn't the best.
You can text me on 07723 58 16 87.
This is a band called Melys.
So I've just missed Melys.
They were playing up in Aberdeen, supporting the wedding present, of all people.
I didn't actually realise that they're once again active
and they're currently working on a new album.
And it's scheduled for release later on this year.
This was one that I fondly look back on.
This is called Chinese Whispers.
We met in the snow Beneath a pond of pite
Tripped into other towns Weekends away
Held hands in the sun Where no one knows our names
Oblivious to everyone But ourselves
Have you seen her? Have you seen her?
Have you seen her? I think she wants him back
And I haven't got the time To try and change your mind
About my foolishness So long as there's a show
You thrive on picking holes In other people's lives
Everything I do Seems to make the news
I hear you whisper in The odds are never mine
I hope one day you'll find Just what I'm feeling like
In cover of dark We drove through lonely streets
To roll for a takeaway Parked up by the beach
Sneaking home by three Someone always saw the car
A love scene on center stage Real-life TV
Have you seen them? Have you seen them?
Have you seen them? I hope it all goes fast
And I haven't got the time To try and change your mind
About my foolishness So long as there's a show
You thrive on picking holes In other people's lives
Everything I do Seems to make the news
I hear you whisper in The odds are never mine
I hope one day you'll find Just what I'm feeling like
Everything I do Seems to make the news
I hear you whisper in The odds are never mine
I hope one day you'll find Just what I'm feeling like
In cover of dark We drove through lonely streets
To roll for a takeaway
We're going to London, or 304 Holloway Road to be precise
This track, it was playlisted really at the last minute
I was listening to the Pop Museum this morning
And Andrew had a, it was a brief segment about the RGM sound
And there were some, the tracks actually they escape me right now
But basically, if you're not familiar, RGM sound was associated with Joe Meek
And I actually think genius is an overused word in the music industry
But Joe Meek truly was a genius
There was nobody like him at the time
And there's nobody really been like him since
So if you didn't catch Andrew this morning
Who actually went into a bit of discussion about him
Joe Meek, he was an independent record producer
And he was just smashing out hit after hit after hit
And he was recording these songs
Well, it was in the flat, it was in a variety
Some of them would be on the staircases, some of them in the bathroom
Because he'd be looking for the dynamic effect of the echoes
Getting off the tiles in the bathroom, what have you
But it wasn't just about throwing up a mic in a random room
Some of his techniques were a bit unorthodox
And like for example, I read in the book
I was going to say that it was not a biography, a biography about him
He would put tacks on the hammer of piano keys
So that when they were playing it, it gave a slightly different sound
There's lots of things like that
And if you're into music, you know, I highly recommend the book
And there's a film actually made, a biopic about him
It's just absolutely fascinating
So as unusual as his unorthodox methods were
There's some highly questionable as well
There's one that sticks in my mind
Where he had a band called The Crying Shames playing on
And if you've heard it, the song's called Please Stay
Just listening to it, you're like, oh, there's so much emotion in that record
It really is, it's a real tearjerker
And it's sung with such conviction
Of course, it's in the book and it's actually, it's documented in the film
He was actually holding a gun to his head
And without really doing any spoilers, I highly recommend you watch the film
It didn't really end well for, well, not just for Joe
But for plenty of others
But really prior to that, you know, anybody and everybody
Has kind of rubbed shoulders or brushed with him
You know, Rod Stewart, Tom Jones
You know, anybody that's somebody back then
There's a good chance
With the exception of The Beatles, of course
Because he famously, Brian Epstein sent some demo tapes
Demo tapes to him and he rejected them
He was just sort of saying, this type of music, it's a flashing pan
It'll never come to anything
So really, really, in the show notes on the Sundown Sessions website
I'll leave some links and information about that film
I really, really highly encourage you to watch it
And if you just, I was a bit of a loose end this afternoon
So I thought I'd do a bit of a mashup
Because if I haven't persuaded you yet
I'm really, really hoping that this 60-second soundscape, if you like
That precedes Fabien Del Sol's Rag and Bone Man
Will be enough to whet your appetite
Hi guys, John Layton
You must be the band
I haven't been home since Wednesday
Can't remember the last time I changed my pants
Maryse, Maryse, get closer
Topping the US charts for the first time ever
It's a British band
Two million copies
John Peel, New Musical Express
Can you get my gold disc in the back here?
Selling like hotcakes
I'm number one again and that's just the start
This is the summons to appear in the Chieftain of the Magistrates Court
There he gets off Billy
This whole Mersey Beat thing, it's a foul
Play it properly or I'll blow your head off
You see what you're doing, you're ruining this for all of us
I'm leaving my love letters
To a ragged bone man
Cos I know
I ain't gonna see you no more
I'm throwing away my broken heart
To a man who weighs cars
You could not break it down like before
If you should decide to come by
I'd be pleased to see you first
Don't think we can start again
Oh no
I'm leaving my love letters
To a ragged bone man
Cos I know
I ain't gonna see you no more
If you should decide to come by
I'd be pleased to see you first
Don't think we can start again
Oh no
I'm leaving my love letters
To a ragged bone man
Cos I know
I ain't gonna see you no more
Cos I know
I ain't gonna see you no more
Yes I know
I ain't gonna see you no more
That was Fabienne Del Sol from the album On My Mind, a track called Ragged Bone Man
I truly, truly believe that sounds like something that Joe Meek would have knocked out

Oh baby I, I see you, you with my, you with my
I got your head off, I put it in my mind
Said I use your balls when I'm on my TV set
I watch TV, I watch TV
Oh sister I, I, I will cheat you with my TV set
Oh baby I, I see you on my radio

Cause you're well preserved in my frigid area
Oh baby, you look so good in my bed at night
Yeah baby, you look so good in my bed at night at all
I could give you a million hugs
You look so good all covered up in grime
So I'll miss you there
Under your chair, but that's alright
I'll see you under the rug
Oh baby, I see you in my TV set
Oh baby, I put what you keep in my TV set
I cut your head off and put it in my TV set
I use your hot dogs for dials on my TV set
I watch TV, I watch TV
I say to her, I see you in my TV set
Oh baby, you look so good in my bed at night
Yeah baby, you look so good in my bed at all
I could give you a million hugs
You look so good all covered up in grime
So I'll miss you there
The band, I'm actually quite excited.
They're playing around more in Glasgow on the 4th of July 2024
and I've managed to secure some tickets, which I'm really pleased about.
This is a cover version of an Otis Redding song.
It's called Shout Bama Lama.
This is the Detroit Cobras.
He down Alabama
I'm shoutin' Bama Lama
Where in Louisiana
Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
Lord, I'm rushin' on my soul
How many chickens have I stole
One last night and the night before
I'm goin' back to try to get ten or eleven more
Started gettin' a meter
I love a chicken, baby
Shout Bama Lama
Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
In nineteen-seven she was lettin' for the view
Nineteen, ten for the ten-feet-a-mill
Nine crept over, drinkin' whiskey and gin
She fell out, but her tongue stayed in
His captain said so
Ooh, I love my chicken, baby
Yeah, shoutin' Bama Lama
Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
Little old monkey told a lie in one day
Said, a band little fella comin' down your way
Talk about your family, it's a cryin' chain
Said your mama's workin' on the chain gang
She's bustin' bricks now
Ooh, she do a workin' mom
Yeah, shoutin' Bama Lama
Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
Diggin' at the preacher for a prayin' one day
Long game of beer comin' down her way
Diggin' sad preacher better say a prayer
Said, oh Lord, I pray I won't kill that bear
I gotta roar for it
Ooh, I gotta make it, baby
Yeah, shoutin' Bama Lama
Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
He down Alabama
Yeah, shoutin' Bama Lama
Way down Louisiana
Well, well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
Shout Bama Lama. The first time I ever heard that
I was actually on art school dancing on a Monday evening
It was a program that my uncle Alastair
That ran for a number of years
And I would tune in quite religiously
So it seems quite fit in given that I'm giving him a little name check
That I dig deep into the archives
And I've managed to fish out a track that is recorded exclusively
For Alastair
It was a band called Becky Becky
That he championed to no end
This is Champagne on Christmas Day
I'm glad it happened
Nobody could see
The room is dark
And I feel giddy
The only light comes in from under the door
I'd like a drink
There's gin on the side
Champagne's what they give them
That's what I ought to have
As you're in home, do me any harm
Champagne's what I ought to
Champagne
Champagne
On Christmas Day
Under the door
The ray of light comes in
Like the last thrust of a round of gold
For everything is blood and doubt
I'll soon start again
I've got no doubt
I thought about being fresh and new
About starting all over again
About missing mornings and some days
And I'll start again all over again
Champagne
All over again
Champagne
Champagne
When I leave, call it
There you go, Becky Becky
And that was Champagne on Christmas Day
Recorded exclusively for Alastair
To be played on his art school dancing show
I'm looking at the time, five minutes
A text has just actually arrived from Jane and Leith
Making a request, I'm just queuing that up
But while I do, I can't quite believe we've only got
Another five minutes or so left
I hope you've enjoyed yourself as much as I have
And just, I'm actually
The show's called Sundown, I'm actually chasing the sun
I'm going to be away for the next two weeks
But you know, fear not
The show is now available on Listen Again
So you can kind of rinse and repeat
You can listen to this show over and again
Or the shows that preceded it
Anyway, from Jane, for Jane and Leith
This is apparently her favourite
This is Simple Minds, I travel
This is Simple Minds
Stay building, falling down
And it all comes falling down
Those riches I see on the wall
Time is clean and standing tall
Assassin in a hit-and-run
Easy as I even talk
Evacuees, refugees
Presidents and monarchies
Drive around, drive around
Dirt that's inside pleasure town
Trags, dudes, low trees
Scatches, pops, galleries
Drive around, drive around
Dirt that's inside pleasure town
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
How's your language, brother?
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
It's time for you and me to march in
March along now, march along now
Oh, something in the restaurant
Airport name, brandy
Drive around, drive around
Dirt that's inside pleasure town
Trags, dudes, low trees
Scatches, pops, galleries
Drive around, drive around
Dirt that's inside pleasure town
Drive around, drive around
Dirt that's inside pleasure town
Trags, dudes, low trees
Scatches, pops, galleries
Europe, how's your language, brother?
