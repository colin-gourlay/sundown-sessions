[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  Smell the wine
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  Well, good evening and welcome. My name is Colin Gurley and you're listening to the Sundown Sessions live on K107.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.300]  and what better way to open the show with Paul McCartney and that was a
[04:00.300 --> 04:05.580]  Smell Away that was actually the last track on the album Ram released back in
[04:05.580 --> 04:12.980]  May 1971 and for those with with a decent memory they might recall that
[04:12.980 --> 04:20.300]  that cover featured Paul McCartney holding a Ram and Lennon a few years
[04:20.300 --> 04:25.060]  later followed that up with it with the original pressing of the Imagine album
[04:25.060 --> 04:30.700]  it came with what became known as Lennon's pig postcard and it depicted
[04:30.700 --> 04:36.740]  John Fondlin pig's ears yeah it's a little bit sad how things panned out but
[04:36.740 --> 04:41.580]  anyway we are here for happy tunes and happy thoughts so not going to dwell on
[04:41.580 --> 04:46.860]  that too much longer and for those wondering why I want to open the show
[04:46.860 --> 04:53.560]  with Paul McCartney you if you listened last week you will no doubt recall that
[04:53.880 --> 05:00.240]  I was just slightly excited about the fact that my wife had secured tickets to
[05:00.240 --> 05:07.760]  go and see Paul down down in Manchester later this year and bless her I am the
[05:07.760 --> 05:14.260]  Beatles fan and I had no idea about it but after the back of watching Get Back
[05:14.260 --> 05:19.060]  which Disney was running some time ago she herself was quite impressed so at
[05:19.060 --> 05:23.900]  the back of that she signed up to the Paul McCartney fan club and was getting
[05:23.900 --> 05:30.460]  notifications about when he was playing and where so I'm terribly grateful she
[05:30.460 --> 05:34.960]  did because she managed to get pre-sale tickets for that event and then she
[05:34.960 --> 05:39.020]  come and running through literally as I was coming out the door to come down to
[05:39.020 --> 05:43.220]  the station last week telling me the great news and you know the time I got
[05:43.220 --> 05:48.580]  to the station I was I was still shaking really was and and I guess I guess to an
[05:48.580 --> 05:51.780]  extent I certainly am I mean there is absolutely nobody that's more pumped up
[05:51.780 --> 05:54.020]  than I
[08:48.940 --> 08:50.940]  Oh
[08:59.860 --> 09:05.300]  Well sooner than I say I can't get any more worked up about that then
[09:05.300 --> 09:09.180]  while that song was playing Collette who's a she's still hanging around the
[09:09.180 --> 09:12.020]  studio she's just packing up she's telling me that she went to see Paul
[09:12.020 --> 09:17.940]  McCartney 2011 I think it was 2011 she just walked out the door and so I can't
[09:17.940 --> 09:23.220]  check but yeah she was she was telling me that I should be really really
[09:23.220 --> 09:30.220]  excited and indeed I am anyway moving on to now that I've got this Beatles thing
[09:30.220 --> 09:35.780]  out my system moving on to a band that was really into really at the back of I
[09:35.780 --> 09:44.340]  have to say this very slowly she sells sanctuary when I saw that first first
[09:44.340 --> 09:51.660]  time this was a lead single by the cult and from the album love and yeah it's
[09:51.660 --> 09:56.100]  just it's ended up turning into a bit of an anthem but I was blown away by that
[09:56.100 --> 10:04.420]  by that record and I asked it so that the album came out 18th October 1985 and
[10:04.420 --> 10:10.780]  you know I wrote a letter to Santa asking asking if I could get a copy of
[10:10.820 --> 10:17.020]  that and well we had big stockings back in it back in that day but I was I was
[10:17.020 --> 10:21.420]  really really delighted that it came my way so I must have been a good boy that
[10:21.420 --> 10:24.860]  year this is the cult
[11:10.780 --> 11:12.780]  when the music began
[11:16.780 --> 11:18.780]  not all around
[11:20.780 --> 11:22.780]  when the music is out
[11:24.780 --> 11:26.780]  every day
[11:28.780 --> 11:30.780]  we are part of
[11:32.780 --> 11:34.780]  always this way
[11:34.780 --> 11:36.780]  yeah
[11:38.780 --> 11:40.780]  every day
[11:42.780 --> 11:44.780]  we are part of
[11:46.780 --> 11:48.780]  always this way
[11:52.780 --> 11:54.780]  when I kick my girls
[11:54.780 --> 11:56.780]  or cheat girls and girls
[12:00.780 --> 12:02.780]  or have them to sit
[12:02.780 --> 12:04.780]  around
[12:06.780 --> 12:08.780]  I don't think
[12:08.780 --> 12:10.780]  there's an easy way out of here
[12:14.780 --> 12:16.780]  but when the music is out
[12:18.780 --> 12:20.780]  we are part of
[12:22.780 --> 12:24.780]  every day
[12:26.780 --> 12:28.780]  we are part of

[16:14.780 --> 16:16.780]  live
[16:16.780 --> 16:22.780]  and Mark Buzeski the drummer from Big Country played on every other track on
[16:22.780 --> 16:29.140]  that album and I can definitely hear his styles the way he kind of does what he
[16:29.140 --> 16:34.140]  does on the Tom Toms. But what I thought was really interesting about that is
[16:34.140 --> 16:39.260]  that although Mark Buzeski played drums on every single track and the one track
[16:39.260 --> 16:44.300]  that Nigel Preston did play on, Mark Buzeski stepped in and on the video
[16:44.300 --> 16:47.740]  She Sells Sanctuary they just threw a leather jacket on him just to make it
[16:47.740 --> 16:51.140]  look like he'd fitted in because he didn't come up for the video shoot that
[16:51.140 --> 16:56.260]  day and he performed drums on that. Anyway around about that time I mean
[16:56.260 --> 17:01.700]  after I got that album I was I was hook, line, and sinker I was a massive massive
[17:01.700 --> 17:07.880]  fan in fact and I saw them saw them many times actually while that record was
[17:07.880 --> 17:12.300]  playing Clet come darting in the door saying haha she's seen them too and I'm
[17:12.300 --> 17:19.940]  like well yeah I can see I've seen them. I've actually seen them a few times once
[17:19.940 --> 17:25.020]  once one that sticks in my mind was back in the March the 5th 1987 and March the
[17:25.020 --> 17:31.140]  5th that's a quite significant date for me that's perhaps a story for another
[17:31.140 --> 17:36.520]  day but a band that was supporting them on that that particular evening that was
[17:36.520 --> 17:41.860]  a part of the electric tour was a band called Gay Bikers on the Acid and they
[17:41.860 --> 17:45.400]  were I'm saying they were part of they were probably responsible for what
[17:45.400 --> 17:51.060]  became known as the very short-lived greeble scene you need to Google what
[17:51.060 --> 17:57.580]  that actually means I've no idea but I do that title sticks for some reason and
[17:57.580 --> 18:03.300]  yeah I was really I was quite taken by them so I again I started I was just at
[18:03.300 --> 18:07.380]  the age where I was in my teens I was just basically spending all my money on
[18:07.380 --> 18:13.140]  records and at the time they were depending were touring with the cult
[18:13.140 --> 18:17.820]  they were promoting their single everything's groovy I thought a bit
[18:17.820 --> 18:23.340]  obvious to go and pay that but I've actually opted for the the follow-up
[18:23.340 --> 18:27.260]  single to that it was also released on in tape it was before Virgin snapped them
[18:27.260 --> 18:34.860]  up and it really didn't come to anything I thought it would but there was so much
[18:34.860 --> 18:38.180]  promotion behind them when they released the album it was just gimmicky
[18:38.180 --> 18:42.420]  things about well the album was called drill your own hole and it was the
[18:42.420 --> 18:48.820]  first 10,000 copies had no center hole and you know and the vinyl LP but with
[18:48.820 --> 18:54.260]  all these gimmicks it just they just didn't seem to convert into sales and
[18:54.260 --> 19:03.220]  yeah the gay bikers sadly no more this is a Nose Dive Karma
[19:54.260 --> 19:57.260]  yeah
[20:00.540 --> 20:10.540]  I was in greed. Nostalgia through your veins. It ain't crap that I need. To make things seem the same.
[20:24.260 --> 20:54.260]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[21:50.080 --> 22:19.080]  My goodness, if you thought that song was hectic, you wouldn't have been in the studio while that was playing, there was just an absolute flurry of activity, which actually serves as a bit of a prompt, first of all.
[22:19.080 --> 22:29.080]  I think I should give out the studio text number in case you want to say what you're enjoying or just let me know that I'm not speaking to a void.
[22:29.080 --> 22:51.080]  You can text me on 07723 58 1687 and really what served as a bit of prompt was Dave Hamilton has just sent a message and saying love the cult good wee show and I actually heard a text from got a very special guest who I'm seeing who was on his way.
[22:51.080 --> 23:01.080]  He's now getting settled but he was just texting me to let me know he was at the door so I'm just going to let him get settled just after these adverts.

[23:48.080 --> 23:56.080]  Get ready to tuck into some tasty toasties, satisfying sandwiches, authentic Belgian waffles, fresh soups and homemade scones.
[23:56.080 --> 24:04.080]  It's time to experience more than coffee at the EcoBean Coffee Bar, they're waiting to serve you Monday to Saturday from 10am.
[24:26.080 --> 24:50.080]  So I'd rather stay in Kirkcaldy and why not? Why not? Well I thought I'd cheek things up a little bit this week and give David Latow a little bit of a rest and play the original.
[24:50.080 --> 24:56.080]  The original, the one that I'm probably more familiar with and that was by the Alexander Brothers.
[24:56.080 --> 25:05.080]  And the familiarity really stems from a time when I would stand in the family enclosure with my dad, my grandad, my uncles.
[25:05.080 --> 25:11.080]  In fact the whole Gurley clan was out there in the family enclosure and that was, you could hear that song.
[25:11.080 --> 25:15.080]  Week in, week out I was adopted by all the fans in the terraces.
[25:15.080 --> 25:26.080]  And it's a rather tenuous link but Wraith Rovers Football Club have played a part in the recovery of Kenny Armour who happens to be my very, very special guest.
[25:26.080 --> 25:33.080]  I'm absolutely thrilled to say that Kenny Armour from Andy's Man Club is joining me this evening. So welcome Kenny.
[25:33.080 --> 25:37.080]  Thank you very much for having me along tonight, it's a pleasure to join you.
[25:37.080 --> 25:49.080]  It's absolutely my pleasure. So for the listeners out there who may not know or may not even have heard of Andy's Man Club, can you tell us a little bit about what Andy's Man Club is?
[25:49.080 --> 25:55.080]  Yeah so as you say Wraith Rovers are a massive part of my recovery and Andy's Man Club is the other part of it.
[25:55.080 --> 26:03.080]  So Andy's Man Club is a peer to peer support group for men, basically having a safe space for men to come in and talk, get things off their chest.
[26:03.080 --> 26:17.080]  Sadly it was set up in 2016 on the back of a suicide so Andy Roberts, 23 year old, took his own life and then from there they created this peer to peer support group which is much more than mental health, it's that social side now.
[26:17.080 --> 26:23.080]  And we're very lucky in Kirkcaldy that we've got one at Starts Park which meet every Monday night.
[26:23.080 --> 26:39.080]  Yeah and of course you're saying it was back all those years ago, it has been, the growth has been quite organic but more recently there's, which is obviously a good thing, Richard Gervais has tweeted, it's been in Sky News and more recently Robbie Williams tweeted.
[26:39.080 --> 26:49.080]  So all that exposure and raising awareness is quite something else and of course the library and some trains are being decorated.
[26:49.080 --> 26:55.080]  In fact, correct me if I'm wrong, I think Andy's mum was somehow involved in the launch of that.
[26:55.080 --> 27:04.080]  Yeah she was, she was along, she still plays a big part in day to day life with Andy's Man Club obviously, raising that awareness and getting more involved.
[27:04.080 --> 27:20.080]  Inside Council is probably another prime example, local to us has got one of the bin lorries in each area, so they've got one in Glenrothes, Cooper and Dunfermline with the sign writing on the side of it which is massive and we're going to be doing a lot more so a bit more local to us as well.
[27:20.080 --> 27:31.080]  And ScotRail, we're probably, I maybe shouldn't be saying this live on air but just next week we'll be doing a launch of a partnership with ScotRail as well so it's exciting times ahead.
[27:31.080 --> 27:44.080]  Well there you go, you heard it first, live on K107, here's a wee exclusive for you. I mean that's terrific, you're saying that, tracking back a little bit, so there's a lot of kind of local events but it is actually a national organisation.
[27:44.080 --> 27:52.080]  It all started just with like, you know, a gathering with 10 people and you know, what sort of numbers are we at now?
[27:52.080 --> 28:01.080]  Yes, as you say, 2016 was, the first night it was nine men walked through the door then it went to 15 and from there it's grown massively.
[28:01.080 --> 28:10.080]  We're coming into the 4th of July, it will be eight years since the first group was ever held and we now have over 4,500 men every week walking through the doors.
[28:10.080 --> 28:21.080]  I believe around about 800 in Scotland just now, we've got 42 clubs in Scotland itself and lucky enough in Fife we've got 13 clubs throughout Fife area as well.
[28:21.080 --> 28:32.080]  So locally presence is massive but nationally it's huge as well and just given that awareness and just getting men talking, having that safe space.
[28:33.080 --> 28:52.080]  I mean it is really incredible how it's grown. So as part of the introduction there, I said Andy's, Kenny from Andy's Man Club, I didn't actually say in what capacity you are involved with, I mean, do you want to talk a little bit about that, what you do now?
[28:52.080 --> 29:08.080]  Yeah, as you say, the recovery was massive so I used Andy's Man Club first and foremost for myself when it opened at Stats Park and then become a volunteer with the charity and now luckily and privileged to be honest, I now work full time for the charity as an area lead.
[29:08.080 --> 29:27.080]  So my role is going to be slightly changing in the coming months but more focusing on Fife area and so just looking after the clubs, helping expand, grow, raise awareness and just make sure the volunteers themselves are well looked after and make sure they've got everything they need to flourish more than anything.
[29:27.080 --> 29:30.080]  What clubs in Fife are up and running at the moment?
[29:30.080 --> 29:48.080]  Yeah, so we've got King Carden, we've got two in Dunfermline, we're in Recythe, Dalgety Bay, we are in Cowdenbeef, Kelty, we're in St Andrews, Cooper, two in Glenrothes and we're in Methil and obviously the heart of Fife, we're in Kirkcaldy as well at Stats Park.
[29:48.080 --> 29:56.080]  So yeah, 13 clubs and we're looking to expand as well so hopefully have a few more clubs come in in the near future as well.
[29:56.080 --> 30:15.080]  That's brilliant. So anybody listening there who is maybe thinking about coming along theirself or they maybe know somebody who they would like to kind of point in the direction, are you able to talk a little bit about what a given, I was going to say a Monday night, it's not every Monday night is it?
[30:15.080 --> 30:44.080]  Yeah, so no, we meet every Monday night at 7pm, except from bank holidays so obviously due to bank holidays our venues are majority of the time given to us free of charge so we do have some bank holidays that we shut but every Monday night at 7pm and it's a safe space for men to come in and talk so as long as you're over the age of 18, you're identified as a male, you're welcome to come through the Doors Andy's Man Club and it's just creating that safe space to come in, get things off your chest.
[30:45.080 --> 30:58.080]  And as much as it was set up on the back of a suicide and mental health, we're there for any man so even just the social side, if it's to get out of the house and have that tea, coffee, biscuit, have the conversations with like minded people, that's what it's all about.
[30:58.080 --> 31:15.080]  We have some people, I know in the Dunfermline group we have an 80 year old who comes in just for the social side, just have the conversations every week with friends now more than anything, they walk in as strangers but they become friends and it's a massive part of the social side as well, just getting out of the house.
[31:16.080 --> 31:35.080]  Yeah and I think that's quite an important point you make actually, you don't have to be at that point, a kind of crisis point if you will, it is just for people getting things off their chest and I guess hopefully leaving the place in a better frame of mind than they did when they came in.
[31:35.080 --> 31:52.080]  So what is a kind of secret sauce then? I mean what does a given Monday look like in a club? So somebody, I'd imagine for some people that might be quite a daunting experience to what goes on inside and just taking that step over the door.
[31:53.080 --> 32:01.080]  So are you able to talk a little bit about what kind of happens inside on a night so if anybody is thinking about coming across they know what to expect?
[32:01.080 --> 32:19.080]  Yeah, no definitely one of the hardest steps is getting through that door the first night. So every club you'll be welcomed just outside the main area of the venue with a welcome face by somebody wearing an Andes Man Club top there, the volunteers that are going to run that session, they're going to take you into the venue.
[32:19.080 --> 32:29.080]  They're going to take you into the venue so we'll use Kirkcaldy as an example, sunny starts park, you're walking up on a Monday night up the main ramp to the main reception area and that's where you'll be welcomed.
[32:30.080 --> 32:41.080]  You'll get taken into the hospitality suite just upstairs, we'll sit in a circle of chairs basically, so we'll sit out in a circle of chairs, normally try and keep the group size around about the 15 mark if we can.
[32:41.080 --> 32:49.080]  If there's slightly more we'll sometimes split into two groups just to accommodate so people are getting that safe space but come 7 o'clock we get cracked on with the meeting.
[32:50.080 --> 33:01.080]  We've got certain rules we go over, we don't talk about religion, politics, medication and criminal matters, other than that it's a safe space to open up and talk and get things off your chest.
[33:02.080 --> 33:08.080]  We sit in a circle of chairs, we pass a ball around, when you've got that ball it's your turn to talk.
[33:09.080 --> 33:16.080]  We ask five questions so as I say it's not designed around the mental health side of things, it's just designed around getting men talking.
[33:17.080 --> 33:25.080]  As you know we're very good at not talking so it's trying to give people that safe space to talk so part of the five questions is the first three questions always stay the same.
[33:26.080 --> 33:35.080]  So we'll ask how's your week been, we'll then ask positive from your week and then we'll ask anything to get off your chest so that's your chance to open up, share, get the things off your chest.
[33:36.080 --> 33:43.080]  May it be small things, may it be big things, it doesn't really matter as much as the important bit is getting that bit off your chest.
[33:44.080 --> 33:49.080]  I know for me sometimes I've got two young kids so just the stresses of having the kids is sometimes enough to get off their chest.
[33:50.080 --> 33:57.080]  It could be that your car's broken down and anything that's affecting you that week it's good to get off your chest.
[33:58.080 --> 34:07.080]  I know this week coming for example I've just completed the Yorkshire free peek so I'll be sharing about how anything off my chest is just my sore legs more than anything.
[34:08.080 --> 34:16.080]  So as much as it's a little thing it's what's bothering me this week but then after that with question three it can be quite difficult.
[34:17.080 --> 34:25.080]  We've got some hard shares in there and it is hard some weeks but we'll have a little break and a regroup basically to make sure everyone is good.
[34:26.080 --> 34:30.080]  And then we go into questions four and five and they're really just the light hearted questions.
[34:31.080 --> 34:38.080]  Question four is kind of designed around positivity, focusing on going forward and goal setting.
[34:39.080 --> 34:47.080]  And question five is just based on a quick fire, light hearted, most important bit as you say at the beginning there was you're leaving on a high more than anything.
[34:48.080 --> 34:53.080]  And yeah just getting that safe space to open up and talk so that's pretty much an Andes man club as a whole.
[34:54.080 --> 34:59.080]  And as I say we're now currently have over 4500 men with nearly 200 groups.
[34:59.080 --> 35:05.080]  The middle of July we'll be into 200 groups nationwide and we also have an online group as well.
[35:06.080 --> 35:13.080]  So for people who struggle socially and maybe not get out of their house or people who don't live near a group we can use the online platform as well.
[35:14.080 --> 35:21.080]  Yeah that's amazing and I guess just tracking back a little bit to what you're saying about the power of the ball.
[35:22.080 --> 35:29.080]  Correct me if I'm wrong I think if I picked you up rightly there's a peer to peer support network.
[35:30.080 --> 35:37.080]  So it's basically when somebody has a ball it's their moment to get they can share as much as they want or as little as they want.
[35:38.080 --> 35:42.080]  They can share nothing if they don't feel ready they just want to kind of come along and see what it's all about.
[35:43.080 --> 35:49.080]  But I guess that could at times be proof cathartic in a way just sometimes even just verbalizing something.
[35:50.080 --> 35:56.080]  You know people may not have the answers but just actually because we are bad.
[35:57.080 --> 36:03.080]  Yeah we're very bad at it. We're getting better slightly but yeah as you say the ball is used to get the things off your chest.
[36:04.080 --> 36:06.080]  And it might take a couple of weeks so there's absolutely no pressure to talk.
[36:07.080 --> 36:14.080]  You can pass the ball around and I think personally speaking listening to other people talking and getting things off your chest has helped me massively.
[36:14.080 --> 36:20.080]  It's gave me things of I'm actually going through that as well and it might not be anything to get off your chest.
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.080]  You can just maybe say I completely agree with you I relate to you I know how you feel.
[36:25.080 --> 36:27.080]  And sometimes that's more powerful than actually sharing.
[36:28.080 --> 36:31.080]  That's right yeah and it kind of validates maybe your mindset at that time.
[36:32.080 --> 36:33.080]  I completely understand that.
[36:34.080 --> 36:38.080]  There's something else you said as well that you know we're talking about the groups about 15.
[36:38.080 --> 36:45.080]  Nobody would be turned away if you know well I'm kind of stating I'm asking the question.
[36:46.080 --> 36:50.080]  You know somebody wanted to rock up on Monday night do they need to be self-referred?
[36:51.080 --> 36:54.080]  Yeah so it's completely as I say the groups are completely free.
[36:55.080 --> 36:59.080]  There's no bookings involved there's no referral involved it's just a case of turning up on a Monday night.
[37:00.080 --> 37:06.080]  What we ask if people can get there for around about quarter to ten to seven as I say the meeting starts at seven o'clock.
[37:06.080 --> 37:09.080]  But it's just a case of turning up to the venues.
[37:10.080 --> 37:13.080]  All that information can be found on the website andyismanclub.co.uk.
[37:14.080 --> 37:19.080]  You can put your postcode and you can see where your nearest group is and yeah it's just a case of turning up.
[37:20.080 --> 37:27.080]  As long as you identify as a male you're over the age of 18 you'll be welcomed into the group and that's there to use.
[37:28.080 --> 37:34.080]  Even if it is for the first few weeks that you're not sharing it's just important that you're in that room.
[37:34.080 --> 37:36.080]  And having the opportunity to share.
[37:37.080 --> 37:39.080]  I mean that sounds really good.
[37:40.080 --> 37:47.080]  Getting to go into Starks Park getting a free cup of tea and a free biscuit you know what's not to like.
[37:48.080 --> 37:54.080]  Actually on that note about free cups of tea and stuff if you're able to share this how's Andy's Man Club actually funded?
[37:55.080 --> 38:01.080]  Yeah so it's obviously it was a personal thing to begin with and one of the things was we wanted to keep it as free as possible.
[38:01.080 --> 38:06.080]  So breaking the barriers down so boys can come in and they don't have to have a charge involved.
[38:07.080 --> 38:12.080]  So we're very lucky we've got a lot of donations coming through venues getting donated to us free of charge.
[38:13.080 --> 38:20.080]  We've got teas and coffees donated to us but we are purely donation based so we rely heavily on donations.
[38:21.080 --> 38:27.080]  Part of my job is to go around and do presentations and work around companies which receive good donations that way which is amazing.
[38:28.080 --> 38:33.080]  But this year we've also started doing our own events as well so we've got a couple of running events.
[38:34.080 --> 38:41.080]  We recently done a fire walk in Glenrothes which was a powerful night and it got raised a lot of money for us as well.
[38:42.080 --> 38:44.080]  But most importantly raising awareness is the biggest bit.
[38:45.080 --> 38:51.080]  But as I say we've just done the Yorkshire Free Peaks on Saturday and my legs are still sore a few days on.
[38:52.080 --> 38:56.080]  And most of that was people raising money for us but at the same time raising awareness for us.
[38:57.080 --> 39:02.080]  If you've got over 200 people walking the Yorkshire Free Peaks shouting about on social media it's massive.
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.080]  We've got a couple of running events coming up which is raising good money for us as well.
[39:08.080 --> 39:11.080]  And all that is going back into the clubs to help more men walk through the door.
[39:12.080 --> 39:19.080]  That's brilliant. So when the adverts were on there earlier when we were just meeting Kerry we were coming up the stairs.
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.080]  When I told him that the studio was upstairs his face said it all and then he was taking it.
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.080]  So I happened to know a little bit about the Free Peaks challenge and your race and that.
[39:30.080 --> 39:35.080]  So that's terrific work. So the information about those running challenges that you mentioned there.
[39:36.080 --> 39:42.080]  So the Delamere, you said you're doing the Great North Front, the Haldane Forest as well, is that right?
[39:43.080 --> 39:45.080]  Yes that's right. So we've got the three of them booked in.
[39:45.080 --> 39:50.080]  So the Delamere Forest is coming up on the 14th of July I believe it is, Sunday.
[39:51.080 --> 39:54.080]  And we've got a 2k fundraise for the kids in that event.
[39:55.080 --> 39:57.080]  We've also got a 10k race and we're also doing a half marathon.
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.080]  On the back of that we've got the Great North Run on the 8th of September.
[40:03.080 --> 40:09.080]  Which we've managed to secure over 300 places for and we've got a further 80 people running on behalf of Andy's Man Club.
[40:09.080 --> 40:15.080]  So I know personally I've been raising money for it and it's been a massive help for my training plan to do it.
[40:16.080 --> 40:22.080]  I'm not the fittest as Colin's realised when I'm walking up those stairs and I'm in agony after just doing a couple of hills.
[40:23.080 --> 40:25.080]  But yeah, training for that, raising the money.
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.080]  Then we've got the Haldane Forest at the end of September as well which is a 10k race.
[40:32.080 --> 40:35.080]  I feel like I should just jump in there. I didn't say you were not the fittest.
[40:35.080 --> 40:40.080]  Not the fittest, I mean anybody who does a marathon distance, the stairs are never going to be your friend.
[40:41.080 --> 40:43.080]  It doesn't matter how fit or unfit you are.
[40:44.080 --> 40:48.080]  But what an achievement that is, it's quite an achievement.
[40:49.080 --> 40:51.080]  With regards to, there was quite a lot of information there.
[40:52.080 --> 40:58.080]  So before you go, before you leave the building, I'll get all that information out of you and then I'll put it on the Sunday In Sessions website.
[40:58.080 --> 41:08.080]  So if anybody's interested in perhaps finding out more, they just want to take part in the race or I'll get a link to you for these events that you're doing.
[41:09.080 --> 41:19.080]  You maybe want to sponsor Kenny yourself or of course if you're keen to find out more about Andy's Man Club I'll put links on to the site.
[41:20.080 --> 41:22.080]  But I mean they should be easy enough to find.
[41:22.080 --> 41:27.080]  They're all across all the socials, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook or X as it's now known.
[41:28.080 --> 41:31.080]  Facebook, of course the website and what have you.
[41:32.080 --> 41:36.080]  So you just type in Andy's Man Club in Google and you'll find it.
[41:37.080 --> 41:39.080]  I just want to thank you again Kenny for coming in.
[41:40.080 --> 41:49.080]  It really is. It's sad in a lot of ways that you've got so many groups and so many people coming.
[41:49.080 --> 42:04.080]  But I'd flip that around. Actually it's a positive that more and more people are, more and more men rather, are finding within themselves to kind of step through that door which has got to be the hardest thing to do.
[42:05.080 --> 42:10.080]  I think once you're through that door I'm reasonably confident you're bowing down what on earth was all the fuss about.
[42:10.080 --> 42:18.080]  But just making that first step so it's easy to think oh those numbers they're quite high but the higher the better in my book.
[42:19.080 --> 42:23.080]  The more people that are talking. So I don't know before we wrap up Kenny have you got anything more you want to add?
[42:24.080 --> 42:32.080]  Just thank you very much for having me along and if there is anybody out there listening who's maybe going through a struggle their self or know anybody then just reach out.
[42:33.080 --> 42:36.080]  Maybe a friend, a family member, just speak to them and have conversations.
[42:36.080 --> 42:46.080]  I know the power of talking is massive. One thing I will do and it's maybe something that you can benefit from your radio show is question five is a quick fire one we use.
[42:47.080 --> 42:57.080]  It's your guilty pleasure song is one of my favourite ones and I'm not afraid to admit that I do like a bit of Westlife and it's a kind of past one.
[42:58.080 --> 43:04.080]  So for any listeners out there it's what is your guilty pleasure song? Let's text it in and get Colin playing it possibly next week.
[43:04.080 --> 43:07.080]  Thank you very much for having me along it's been a pleasure.
[43:08.080 --> 43:13.080]  Thanks very much Kenny. Listen it would be great to you know in a few months time it would be great to actually have you back in.
[43:14.080 --> 43:21.080]  I'd love to hear more about how things are going with Andy's Man Club and hopefully the continued growth and more clubs and more men.
[43:22.080 --> 43:25.080]  Hopefully this gets out and reaches that one man and let's keep on talking.
[43:34.080 --> 43:36.080]  Touch my heart,
[43:38.080 --> 43:40.080]  Help me close,
[43:43.080 --> 43:49.080]  You were always there by my side,
[43:52.080 --> 43:54.080]  Night and day,
[43:56.080 --> 43:58.080]  Through it all,
[43:59.080 --> 44:04.080]  Baby come what may,
[44:05.080 --> 44:08.080]  Swept away on a wave of emotion,
[44:09.080 --> 44:13.080]  I were caught in the eye of the storm,
[44:14.080 --> 44:20.080]  And whenever you smile I can hardly believe that you're mine,
[44:22.080 --> 44:25.080]  Believe that you're mine,
[44:26.080 --> 44:30.080]  This love is unbreakable,
[44:31.080 --> 44:34.080]  It's unmistakable,
[44:35.080 --> 44:39.080]  And each time I look in your eyes,
[44:40.080 --> 44:43.080]  I know why,
[44:44.080 --> 44:48.080]  This love is untouchable,
[44:49.080 --> 44:53.080]  I feel that my heart just can't deny,
[44:53.080 --> 44:56.080]  Each time I look in your eyes,
[44:57.080 --> 45:01.080]  Oh baby I know why,
[45:02.080 --> 45:06.080]  This love is unbreakable,
[45:07.080 --> 45:10.080]  Share the laughter,
[45:11.080 --> 45:15.080]  Share the tears,
[45:16.080 --> 45:19.080]  We both know,
[45:20.080 --> 45:24.080]  We'll go on from here,
[45:25.080 --> 45:27.080]  Cause together,
[45:29.080 --> 45:32.080]  We are strong,
[45:33.080 --> 45:36.080]  In my arms,
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.080]  That's where you'll be alone,
[45:43.080 --> 45:46.080]  I've been touched by the hands of an angel,
[45:46.080 --> 45:50.080]  I've been blessed by the power of love,
[45:51.080 --> 45:58.080]  And whenever you smile I can hardly believe that you're mine,
[45:59.080 --> 46:03.080]  This love is unbreakable,
[46:04.080 --> 46:07.080]  It's unmistakable,
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.080]  And each time I look in your eyes,
[46:13.080 --> 46:16.080]  I know why,
[46:17.080 --> 46:21.080]  This love is untouchable,
[46:22.080 --> 46:26.080]  I feel that my heart just can't deny,
[46:27.080 --> 46:29.080]  Each time you whisper my name,
[46:30.080 --> 46:33.080]  Oh baby I know why,
[46:35.080 --> 46:39.080]  This love is unbreakable,
[46:40.080 --> 46:43.080]  Fire and flame,
[46:44.080 --> 46:48.080]  When all this is over,
[46:49.080 --> 46:53.080]  Our love still remains,
[46:55.080 --> 46:59.080]  This love is unbreakable,
[47:00.080 --> 47:04.080]  It's unmistakable,
[47:05.080 --> 47:08.080]  Each time I look in your eyes,
[47:09.080 --> 47:12.080]  I know why,
[47:13.080 --> 47:17.080]  This love is untouchable,
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.080]  I feel that my heart just can't deny,
[47:23.080 --> 47:25.080]  Each time you whisper my name,
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.080]  Oh baby I know why,
[47:31.080 --> 47:34.080]  Each time I look in your eyes,
[47:34.080 --> 47:38.080]  Oh baby I know why,
[47:42.080 --> 47:46.080]  This love is unbreakable,
[47:54.080 --> 47:57.080]  There you go, that was Westlife and Unbreakable.
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.080]  And it probably appears in the interviewer's handbook,
[48:04.080 --> 48:07.080]  So one guide, always vet your guests in the future,
[48:08.080 --> 48:10.080]  In case they have such guilty pleasures,
[48:11.080 --> 48:14.080]  I can assure you, that will be the first and last time
[48:15.080 --> 48:17.080]  That Westlife will ever feature on this show.
[48:18.080 --> 48:22.080]  But you know, I decided to bend or break my own rule,
[48:23.080 --> 48:29.080]  Because my wife Deborah, she secured me tickets for Paul McCartney,
[48:30.080 --> 48:32.080]  And that song featured in her wedding,
[48:32.080 --> 48:34.080]  Yeah, so I'm a big softie deep down.
[48:35.080 --> 48:38.080]  But you know, save Kenny's blushes,
[48:39.080 --> 48:43.080]  I don't think Alex McIntlock or Mark Ingalls should get away lightly either,
[48:44.080 --> 48:45.080]  So just for context,
[48:46.080 --> 48:49.080]  Alex McIntlock is the head of groups in Scotland for Andy's Man Club,
[48:50.080 --> 48:55.080]  And he's revealed that his guilty pleasures is Starships by Nicki Minaj,
[48:56.080 --> 48:57.080]  And it gets better yet,
[48:58.080 --> 48:59.080]  Mark Ingalls, who's also an area lead,
[48:59.080 --> 49:02.080]  This is Barbie Girl by Aqua,
[49:03.080 --> 49:06.080]  So yeah, I'll keep that in the back of my mind,
[49:07.080 --> 49:08.080]  Always vet your guests.
[49:29.080 --> 49:31.080]  Ouch, it's the first thing I pack now.
[49:32.080 --> 49:36.080]  In an emergency at the coast, call 999 and ask for the Coast Guard,
[49:37.080 --> 49:38.080]  And please, respect the water.
[49:39.080 --> 49:40.080]  When it comes to selling your home,
[49:41.080 --> 49:44.080]  No one knows the local market better than Fife Properties,
[49:45.080 --> 49:48.080]  Here's what Colin Davidson said about selling in London Links,
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.080]  Fife Properties I found offer five-star service,
[49:52.080 --> 49:54.080]  This company continues to surpass expectations,
[49:55.080 --> 49:57.080]  The standard of service, attention to detail,
[49:57.080 --> 50:00.080]  And passion for the customer I found was exceptional,
[50:01.080 --> 50:03.080]  Don't go anywhere else to buy or sell a house.
[50:04.080 --> 50:07.080]  Fife Properties, helping you manage life as it happens.
[50:27.080 --> 50:49.080]  Music
[50:50.080 --> 50:52.080]  Suffocate me with kisses baby,
[50:53.080 --> 50:56.080]  Suffocate me with a burning love,
[50:57.080 --> 51:00.080]  Suffocate me, put your chains around me,
[51:01.080 --> 51:06.080]  Suffocate me, I'm thirsted up.
[51:13.080 --> 51:16.080]  Suffocate me with conversation,
[51:17.080 --> 51:20.080]  Suffocate me with unsaid words,
[51:21.080 --> 51:24.080]  Suffocate me with indecision,
[51:24.080 --> 51:29.080]  Suffocate me with who comes first.
[51:36.080 --> 51:39.080]  I love you, you're so religious,
[51:40.080 --> 51:43.080]  I get a thrill when the curtain calls,
[51:44.080 --> 51:47.080]  I feel like a Roman candle,
[51:48.080 --> 51:52.080]  Do your stuff while the Empire falls.
[51:54.080 --> 51:57.080]  Suffocate me.
[52:24.080 --> 52:32.080]  Music
[52:33.080 --> 52:38.080]  I love you, I love you,
[52:40.080 --> 52:46.080]  I love you, I love you,
[52:46.080 --> 52:54.080]  I love you, you know I do.
[52:55.080 --> 53:01.080]  Suffocate me, suffocate me,
[53:02.080 --> 53:09.080]  Suffocate me, suffocate me,
[53:10.080 --> 53:15.080]  Suffocate me, suffocate me,
[53:16.080 --> 53:19.080]  Suffocate me, suffocate me,
[53:20.080 --> 53:24.080]  Suffocate me, suffocate me,
[53:25.080 --> 53:31.080]  Suffocate me, suffocate me,
[53:32.080 --> 53:37.080]  Suffocate me, suffocate me,
[53:38.080 --> 53:43.080]  Suffocate me.
[53:46.080 --> 53:50.720]  there was ever a record that demonstrated that being at the right place at the right time
[53:52.080 --> 53:56.640]  can be quite important, you've just listened to it. That was Angel Fish and a track called
[53:56.640 --> 54:05.040]  Suffocate Me from the album Angel Fish released back in 1994 and that was famously aired just the
[54:05.040 --> 54:13.600]  once during a late night show on MTV. I think the show was called 120 Minutes but crucially
[54:13.600 --> 54:19.440]  it was only ever played once and it just so happened that a chap called Steve Marker
[54:21.680 --> 54:29.760]  who was a co-founder of Garbage caught that and invited Manson to join the band.
[54:30.560 --> 54:35.120]  Of course I'm saying of course you may or may not know this the Angel Fish was actually a side
[54:35.120 --> 54:42.000]  project by a band Goodbye Mr Mackenzie and up until that point certainly Goodbye Mr Mackenzie
[54:42.000 --> 54:50.080]  was Martin Metcalf that took lead vocals and surely up to that point she did provide on some
[54:50.080 --> 54:55.520]  tracks particularly some of the album tracks it was more backing vocals and keyboards and
[54:55.520 --> 55:01.760]  she did play guitar occasionally as well. So I think it'd be a bit obvious to play
[55:02.560 --> 55:08.400]  Garbage but we'll have no garbage on this so let's go for Goodbye Mr Mackenzie instead.
[55:08.400 --> 55:11.760]  This is Normal Boy.
[55:38.400 --> 55:41.760]  This is Normal Boy.
[56:08.400 --> 56:12.560]  I believe in pain who doesn't always want to do it again
[56:13.280 --> 56:19.760]  who is addicted to Australian soaps a girl that doesn't tell filthy jokes
[57:08.480 --> 57:23.120]  That was Normal Boy released from the album 5 and we'll have more of Goodbye Mr Mackenzie
[57:23.120 --> 57:30.080]  shortly so Finn Wilson and Martin Metcalf are actually they're touring with the skids
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.960]  I'm saying touring they're actually playing with the skids at the moment and we might just have a
[57:34.960 --> 57:41.200]  chance to shoehorn this in just ahead in the news it'll be maybe less than a minute but we'll we'll
[57:41.200 --> 57:53.680]  see where we get
[57:53.680 --> 58:08.240]  From the Sky News Centre at 9 the family of Zara Alina say her murder could and should have been
[58:08.240 --> 58:14.560]  prevented after an inquest discovered failings by multiple agencies she was killed as she walked
[58:14.560 --> 58:19.680]  home from a night out Matt Steele has more. It's two years to the day since Zara failed to make
[58:19.680 --> 58:25.200]  it home in Ilford in East London her attacker Jordan McSweeney had been freed from jail just
[58:25.200 --> 58:31.040]  nine days earlier authorities underestimated the risk he posed didn't share information
[58:31.040 --> 58:35.840]  and were too slow to react when he skipped probation appointments Zara's aunt calls the
[58:35.840 --> 58:41.600]  findings devastating but hopes the verdict will protect other women and girls a court's heard a
[58:41.600 --> 58:46.640]  man accused of plotting to kidnap and murder Holly Willoughby sent voice notes to an undercover
[58:46.640 --> 58:53.680]  police officer they detailed plans to restrain the TV presenter using chloroform Gavin Plum denies
[58:53.680 --> 58:59.040]  the charges the two men who want to be prime minister next week are taking part in their
[58:59.040 --> 59:04.800]  final head-to-head debate before the election and the gambling row was top of the agenda
[59:04.800 --> 59:10.560]  Rishi Sunak says he was furious to hear about party officials placing bets while Sir Kirstama
[59:10.560 --> 59:16.080]  accuses him of being bullied into action both took the opportunity to attack their rivals
[59:16.080 --> 59:22.320]  integrity the prime minister himself was convicted and fined for breaking the rules which he brought
[59:22.320 --> 59:26.800]  in and imposed on everybody else he doesn't have the courage of his convictions and is not being
[59:26.800 --> 59:32.240]  straight with everybody now about his plans if he wins power to raise people's taxes Kenya's
[59:32.240 --> 59:37.840]  president has withdrawn a controversial tax bill after protesters stormed the parliament in Nairobi
[59:37.840 --> 59:43.040]  the law sparked widespread protests across the country as things stand England will be playing
[59:43.040 --> 59:49.120]  Slovakia in the last 16 of euro 2024 on Sunday that's because Georgia are beating Portugal one

[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.060]  you
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:16.240]  oops um press the wrong button there okay just two more mate and uh
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:35.440]  okay yes that was the news and this is goodbye Mr Mackenzie
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:45.440]  oh
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:01:04.240]  well I'm going down to the 40 cell to recover you I might as well I've seen you dumb
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:13.040]  and I've seen you smart and I saw you rocking the apple cart now you're making it hard
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:23.440]  you're making it harder now harder now you're making it hard
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.640]  harder
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.840]  he used to make things so easy
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.320]  he used to make things so easy
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.440]  he used to make things so easy
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.640]  he used to make it easy now you're making it hard
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:02.640]  oh
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:19.280]  well I've seen you dumb and I've seen you smart and I saw you blow up
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:31.120]  the apple cart
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.320]  ego after that false start that was goodbye goodbye Mr Mackenzie
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:55.760]  and hard and before the news I tried I tried very hard to shoe shoe horn a skids track
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.680]  from from the album days in Europa it was charade and just really on that note like
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.800]  Finn Wilson as I said uh Mark Metcalfe they're actually now playing with the skids uh Bruce
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:15.200]  Watson and Jamie Watson originally from big country of course um their commitments to big
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:21.360]  country were kind of getting pressing so it left the skids um in need of a bass player and
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.720]  a guitarist and of course Martin Metcalfe has done a lot of work with Richard Jobson
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:33.280]  over the years working on a soundtrack and to film what have you so it seemed an obvious natural fit
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:39.120]  and Martin himself is um has never been backward and forward and saying that he's been a long time
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:48.720]  fan of the skid so he's it's obviously important to him and I picked that particular track just
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.840]  because the euro's going on I thought yeah we'll just go for something off days in Europa and I
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.120]  didn't realize at the time actually I mean I've got that was a vinyl version um sorry vinyl
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:07.520]  version that was a track from my own vinyl album and I was just curious because I know that the
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:15.360]  album I have it since been withdrawn because the cover um yeah it's probably not really safe
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:21.760]  to say but basically the album cover I have it was just drawn and uh if you have the particular
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:29.520]  one that I have um with uh shall we just say with the the Olympian on the front um hold on to it
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:36.720]  because I checked in the record collector's rare rare price guide and uh it's worth a few bobs so
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.000]  I mean not that I'll ever part with it but um it's just nice to know I'm sitting on a wee
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  wee treasure chest so that was before the news um I think you maybe got a couple of bars of that
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.600]  at a push um and we followed that up with uh the second goodbye mr mckenzie track of the evening
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:01.200]  and that was hard and I was absolutely delighted to hear although I've just said that they have
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.800]  commitments with skids at the moment um when that's all wrapped up they are going to be
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:13.840]  playing as goodbye mr mcken goodbye mr mckenzie slash the filthy tongues um they're juggling
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:19.520]  quite a few bands at the same time um but there's a couple of goodbye mr mckenzie gigs lined up
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:28.560]  because they've um I'm saying up to now still still at this moment in time uh the album five
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.320]  is not available for download or any of the streaming platforms which uh you know I'm not
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:40.160]  here nor there about it I have my own copy but um they're actually remastering reissuing it um
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:47.360]  and you know the the variety uh color vinyls it's coming um so I'm looking forward to that um
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.920]  because a couple of years back when they done some anniversary gigs off their first album
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:58.080]  good deeds and dirty rags uh that was remastered and uh whoever was whoever was behind the
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:03.120]  remastered and done an absolutely sterling job uh was really good so I'm looking forward to that
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:08.880]  when it comes out I believe it's later on this year but uh as soon as I hear I'll be the first
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:16.240]  to share it on this show uh they're a band really that that album hard and for that matter the one
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:23.520]  before uh normal boy it's quite far removed from their the first few albums and uh I remember big
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:29.280]  john duncan in an interview saying that um they were really hoping that this album captured
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.760]  what they sounded like live and I I'm inclined to actually agree with that um
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.840]  uh I think that could be the last time I saw them certainly the last time I saw them when
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.560]  Shirley Manson was playing with them when it was the full output uh john duncan finn wilson
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:53.840]  mccaff kelly on drums um they they were just absolutely phenomenal and that was just across
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:07:00.400]  the road actually in the adam smith center uh the year absolutely escapes me but um that was a
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.120]  phenomenal gig and uh that was the opening track of that set actually I just remember
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.880]  finn wilson coming on playing that that really hard bass it just seemed to go on forever and then
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:14.400]  the fog I mean you could literally not see there was so much fog going on
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.760]  john duncan came on and you know there's coming on one at a time but the one thing that really
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:25.280]  sticks in my mind about that it's really really odd um well maybe if you play the guitar you
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:35.600]  might understand where I'm coming from um uh yep sorry um I was a bit distracted by some mouse
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:44.640]  movement going on there um so uh where was I sorry I've lost lost my train of thought um
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:52.320]  yeah the one thing that really sticks in my mind that's it yeah um being a guitar player um I'm
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:58.080]  known to have a bit of guitar envy and I remember quite distinctly Shirley Manson playing a blue
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:04.480]  rickenbacker and why it really sticks in my mind because it was an unusual shape um it's not um
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.320]  yeah it was just an unusual but I don't want to kind of go into the whole anirachy thing
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:14.320]  about guitars because uh I think I might lose a few listeners if I haven't already done so
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.680]  I think the point I'm trying to make is it's just as funny the things you remember
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:23.840]  and actually on that note um I took uh took a run up to see my gig buddy well I'm seeing my gig
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:29.280]  buddy he's actually he's a very very good friend it's uh we go to a lot of gigs together and he
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:33.920]  works up at Perth kitchen center and they've they've recently moved premises so I went up to
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:39.920]  see him it was long overdue and it was on the way back um I don't know how I managed it I somehow
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:46.400]  took a wrong turn and went past the Perth city hall and a whole lot of really happy memories
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.520]  came back but without much further ado we'll play the track that this
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.920]  this really just evoked those memories this is Hipsway
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.640]  Back
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.640]  Outside the hotel
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.360]  On the balcony
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.400]  Hands on the railing
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:53.440]  Asking me, asking me where's the fire through the window in my face
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.440]  Or take a look in my eyes
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.440]  Well, some things never leave you
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.440]  Some things never leave you
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.440]  Take a look in my eyes
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.440]  Well, some things never leave you
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:28.440]  Oh, I've been waiting so long
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.440]  I've been walking on hot snow
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.440]  Yeah, I've been moving on slow train
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:39.440]  Yeah, I've been walking on hot snow
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.440]  Yeah, I've been thinking about seven
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.440]  The world on fire
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.440]  Seven in the morning
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.440]  Tender all my money
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:05.440]  On the great western road
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.440]  Cool wind in my face
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.440]  Or take a look in my eyes
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.440]  Well, some things never leave you
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:23.440]  Some things never leave you
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:31.440]  Oh, I've been waiting for so long
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.440]  I've been walking on hot snow
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.440]  Yeah, I've been moving on slow train
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.440]  Yeah, I've been walking on hot snow
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.440]  Yeah, I've been thinking about seven
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.440]  The world on fire
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.440]  I've been thinking about seven
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.440]  The world on fire
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440]  I've been thinking about seven
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.440]  The world on fire
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.440]  I've been thinking about seven
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.440]  The world on fire
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.440]  I've been thinking about seven
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.440]  The world on fire
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.440]  Some things never leave you
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.440]  Some things never leave you
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.440]  Some things never leave you
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.440]  Some things never leave you
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:41.440]  Set in the woods, set it on fire
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:49.440]  Set in the woods, set it on fire
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:12.440]  Oh, I've been waiting for so long
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.440]  I've been walking on hot stone
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.440]  Yeah, I've been moving on slow train
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.440]  Yeah, I've been walking on hot stone
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:31.440]  Yeah, I've been thinking about setting the world on fire
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:39.440]  I've been thinking about setting the world on fire
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:47.440]  I've been thinking about setting the world on fire
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.440]  That was Hipsway and a track called Tinder from the album Hipsway
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.440]  Released back in 1986, if I remember rightly
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:12.440]  You know, whether I've got the year right or wrong, those of a certain age will, I'm absolutely certain, will remember that
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:20.440]  Because it featured really heavily on the McEwan's Lager adverts
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.440]  And that indeed was the one with the train stations
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:31.440]  Now I know, I know, I know, certainly if you were in my circles, if you're listening to this you'll be screaming at the radio
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.440]  You're not interested in that one, you want the one where we're pushing the stones up the hill
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.440]  Well, sit back and relax, I've got you sorted
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.440]  That was Hipsway and a track called Tinder from the album Hipsway
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.440]  Released back in 1986, if I remember rightly
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:09.440]  You know, whether I've got the year right or wrong, those of a certain age will, I'm absolutely certain, will remember that
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:14.440]  Because it featured really heavily on the McEwan's Lager adverts
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.440]  And that indeed was the one with the train stations
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:50.440]  It's a crazy chain that cuts the drug
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.440]  That eats the fool who's golden hungry
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:01.440]  Soft and scared and troubled, ugly
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:06.440]  You've got the power to generate fear
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.440]  You've got the power, you've got the power
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.440]  You've got the power to sense all that is real
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.440]  You've got the power, you've got the power
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:38.440]  Oh, net people, question quiz
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.440]  Are we searching for what the answer is?
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.440]  No solution, turn, turn, turn
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.440]  Revolution rhymes with world
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.440]  You've got the power to generate fear
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.440]  You've got the power, you've got the power
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.440]  You've got the power to sense all that is real
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:07.440]  You've got the power, you've got the power
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah

[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:39.440]  Ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.440]  You've got the power to generate fear
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.440]  You've got the power, you've got the power
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:52.440]  You've got the power to sense what is real
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:57.440]  You've got the power, you've got the power
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:01.440]  You've got the power to generate fear
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.440]  You've got the power, you've got the power
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.440]  It's a freeze that you have
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.440]  That cuts the throat
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.440]  That eats the food
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.440]  It's a freeze that you have
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.440]  That cuts the throat
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.440]  That eats the food
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.440]  You've got the power
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.440]  You've got the power
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.440]  You've got the power
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.440]  You've got the power
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.440]  You've got the power
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.440]  You've got the power
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.440]  You've got the power
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.440]  You've got the power
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.440]  That was when, and you've got the power
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.440]  It was released, it appeared on the album rather
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.440]  A Tears Baby, a Trash Icon
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:46.440]  And prior to that it had actually been released
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:49.440]  Re-released and re-re-released
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.440]  And to this day I'm still scratching my head
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:55.440]  Trying to understand why that single was never hit
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.440]  At the final time of asking
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.440]  Cadbury's Flake were sponsoring
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:05.440]  Sponsoring that leaf just because the front cover
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.440]  Featured a baby hold on a flake
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.440]  I'm not really quite sure what the significance of all that
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.440]  Or the relationship rather was
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.440]  Because it was an anti-heroin song
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.440]  So Cadbury's were sponsoring it
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.440]  They were fronted by Davey Henderson
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.440]  Who formerly of the Fire Engines
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:24.440]  So there's naturally a bit of interest around him himself
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.440]  And I remember quite vividly
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.440]  I was at a record fair
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.440]  I don't know if they still run them
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.440]  In the assembly rooms in Edinburgh
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.440]  After going to a record fair
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.440]  I went into, because I hadn't splurged enough money
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.440]  I went into, it could have been HMV or Virgin
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.440]  I can't quite remember
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.440]  The two shops were right next to each other on Princess Street
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.440]  But I remember coming down the elevator
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.440]  And it was floor to ceiling
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.440]  It was copies, 12 inch copies
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.440]  Of when you got the power
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.440]  I know myself
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:02.440]  I've got at least half a dozen copies
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:05.440]  You know, the gatefold
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:08.440]  The gatefold 7 inch, the double pack
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.440]  Just the way they did all the packaging back then
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.440]  To try and increase the numbers
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:16.440]  But my copies it seems weren't quite enough
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:19.440]  Yeah, on top of that I missed
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.440]  I missed probably the biggest kind of connection
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.440]  After Tinder and Hipsway
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.440]  It was heavily featured on the McEwen's Lager advert
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.440]  And of course I made reference to the one
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.440]  Pushing the stones up the hill
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.440]  But despite all that
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.440]  It didn't come to anything
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.440]  Anyway, by way of balance
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.440]  I don't know how many times I've mentioned McEwen's Lager
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.440]  Just as part of that story
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.440]  Like everything, everything's okay in moderation
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.440]  This next song is by a Glasgow band
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.440]  The harmonies on this
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.440]  Towards the end, I'm not wishing the song away
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.440]  But please just listen
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.440]  Pay attention to the harmonies at the end
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.440]  They're just quite something else
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:01.440]  This is called The Dirty Thirst
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.440]  The ocean can lead to inspiration
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.440]  But tonight I'm just another
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.440]  Guy without a mother
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.440]  Servicing this dirty thirst
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.440]  I don't want to wipe
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.440]  All traces
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.440]  What feels good tonight
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.440]  Will feel bad in the morning light
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.440]  I got wasted
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.440]  I'm not strong enough
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.440]  To resist my dirty thirst
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.440]  These faces
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.440]  Don't seem right
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.440]  Keeping it together
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.440]  With dreams as wild as ever
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.440]  No need to be nervous
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.440]  The drink will cure the scaredness
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:16.440]  There's no room here for dignity
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.440]  Now we say we're leaving
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.440]  I'm turned on by the feeling
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.440]  Gonna touch you up
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.440]  Fill my dirty cup
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.440]  The night is made a mess of me
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.440]  I don't want to wipe
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.440]  All traces
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.440]  What feels good tonight
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.440]  Will feel bad in the morning light
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.440]  I got wasted
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.440]  I'm not strong enough
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:48.440]  To resist my dirty thirst
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.440]  These faces
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.440]  Don't seem right
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.440]  Don't seem right
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.440]  I don't want to wipe
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.440]  All traces
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.440]  What feels good tonight
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.440]  Will feel bad in the morning light
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.440]  I got wasted
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.440]  I'm not strong enough
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.440]  To resist
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.440]  I don't want to wipe
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.440]  All traces
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.440]  What feels good tonight
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:50.440]  Will feel bad in the morning light
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.440]  I got wasted
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.440]  I'm not strong enough
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.440]  To resist
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.440]  I don't want to wipe
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.440]  All traces
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.440]  What feels good tonight
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:06.440]  Will feel bad in the morning light
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.440]  I got wasted
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.440]  I'm not strong enough
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.440]  To resist
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.440]  I don't want to wipe
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.440]  These faces
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.440]  Don't seem right
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.440]  From luxurious carpets
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.440]  To durable vinyl and laminate flooring
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:45.440]  To a fantastic selection of beds and sofas
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.440]  We have you covered
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.440]  We also supply a range of hand and power tools
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.440]  To help you get the job done right
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.440]  Make your house a home
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.440]  Visit us on the high street in Loch Gellie
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.440]  Or shop online at
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.440]  Broadwayinteriors.co.uk
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:04.440]  If you see somebody showing any of the signs of a stroke
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.440]  You don't have to think about it
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.440]  Use the FAST test
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.440]  Has their face fallen on one side?
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.440]  Can they smile?
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.440]  Can they raise both arms and keep them there?
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.440]  Is their speech slurred?
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:28.440]  Time to call 999 if you see any one of these signs
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:31.440]  Act fast, make the call, dial 999
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:41.440]  Now you're back in my arms again
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.440]  Let your heart be rearranged
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.440]  While you were sleeping
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.440]  The reaper's been reaping
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.440]  The times have changed
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.440]  The speech's up in the air
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.440]  The heart's beating
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.440]  The heart's beating
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.440]  But don't give in
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.440]  If you should climb to the top of the world
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.440]  Just to take it all but shit
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.440]  Why would it matter if the world seemed to shatter
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:51.440]  Is it the world you believe in?
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.440]  You crawl to the ends of the earth
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:59.440]  As the sea breeze caving in
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.440]  Our knees put back right
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.440]  All the seas unwrapped
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.440]  All the reason for living
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.440]  With flesh and blood and small shame
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.440]  We start a little something new
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:33.440]  Rather lead and be mistaken
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.440]  Than following and faking
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:40.440]  For the sake of seeming true
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:48.440]  All the stars and the satellite shine down on you
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:52.440]  But which will you heed?
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:57.440]  If you should climb to the top of the world
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:01.440]  Just to take it all but shit
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:05.440]  Why would it matter if the world seemed to shatter
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:09.440]  Is it the world you believe in?
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.440]  You crawl to the ends of the earth
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.440]  As the sea breeze caving in
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.440]  Our knees put back right
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.440]  All the seas unwrapped
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:25.440]  All the reason for living
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.440]  In fact you've drowned in the light of your eyes
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:34.440]  I'd rather die giving
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.440]  Wipe the light with some grace
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.440]  And say what in a race
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:42.440]  Ain't that a reason for living
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:46.440]  That, in my opinion, is a perfect pop record.
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.440]  It really is.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:54.440]  From the album, The North Star, that was Roddy Fraym, of course, formerly off Astate Camera.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.440]  That song was called Reason for Living.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.440]  It was a single but it just didn't even make a dent in the charts.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.440]  Yeah, astonishing.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.440]  Anyway, I'm conscious that I have been playing.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.440]  It's not deliberate, it's just been a happy coincidence.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:12.440]  I've been playing a number of back-to-back Scottish tracks.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:15.440]  So I think it's probably time to redress that balance.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:20.440]  And really, if you care to correct me, my Welsh isn't the best.
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:26.440]  You can text me on 07723 58 16 87.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:30.440]  This is a band called Melys.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.440]  So I've just missed Melys.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:39.440]  They were playing up in Aberdeen, supporting the wedding present, of all people.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.440]  I didn't actually realise that they're once again active
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.440]  and they're currently working on a new album.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:50.440]  And it's scheduled for release later on this year.
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:55.440]  This was one that I fondly look back on.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.440]  This is called Chinese Whispers.
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:24.440]  We met in the snow Beneath a pond of pite
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:35.440]  Tripped into other towns Weekends away
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:42.440]  Held hands in the sun Where no one knows our names
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:53.440]  Oblivious to everyone But ourselves
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:33:02.440]  Have you seen her? Have you seen her?
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:09.440]  Have you seen her? I think she wants him back
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:14.440]  And I haven't got the time To try and change your mind
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:21.440]  About my foolishness So long as there's a show
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:28.440]  You thrive on picking holes In other people's lives
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:33.440]  Everything I do Seems to make the news
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:39.440]  I hear you whisper in The odds are never mine
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:48.440]  I hope one day you'll find Just what I'm feeling like
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:55.440]  In cover of dark We drove through lonely streets
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:06.440]  To roll for a takeaway Parked up by the beach
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:14.440]  Sneaking home by three Someone always saw the car
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:21.440]  A love scene on center stage Real-life TV
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:34.440]  Have you seen them? Have you seen them?
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:41.440]  Have you seen them? I hope it all goes fast
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:46.440]  And I haven't got the time To try and change your mind
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:53.440]  About my foolishness So long as there's a show
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:35:00.440]  You thrive on picking holes In other people's lives
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:05.440]  Everything I do Seems to make the news
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:11.440]  I hear you whisper in The odds are never mine
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:18.440]  I hope one day you'll find Just what I'm feeling like
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:35.440]  Everything I do Seems to make the news
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:41.440]  I hear you whisper in The odds are never mine
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:48.440]  I hope one day you'll find Just what I'm feeling like
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:55.440]  In cover of dark We drove through lonely streets
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:00.440]  To roll for a takeaway
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:31.440]  We're going to London, or 304 Holloway Road to be precise
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.440]  This track, it was playlisted really at the last minute
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.440]  I was listening to the Pop Museum this morning
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:43.440]  And Andrew had a, it was a brief segment about the RGM sound
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:49.440]  And there were some, the tracks actually they escape me right now
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:54.440]  But basically, if you're not familiar, RGM sound was associated with Joe Meek
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:37:04.440]  And I actually think genius is an overused word in the music industry
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.440]  But Joe Meek truly was a genius
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:11.440]  There was nobody like him at the time
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.440]  And there's nobody really been like him since
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:17.440]  So if you didn't catch Andrew this morning
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:20.440]  Who actually went into a bit of discussion about him
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.440]  Joe Meek, he was an independent record producer
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:31.440]  And he was just smashing out hit after hit after hit
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.440]  And he was recording these songs
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:37.440]  Well, it was in the flat, it was in a variety
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.440]  Some of them would be on the staircases, some of them in the bathroom
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:45.440]  Because he'd be looking for the dynamic effect of the echoes
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.440]  Getting off the tiles in the bathroom, what have you
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.440]  But it wasn't just about throwing up a mic in a random room
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:57.440]  Some of his techniques were a bit unorthodox
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:02.440]  And like for example, I read in the book
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.440]  I was going to say that it was not a biography, a biography about him
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:09.440]  He would put tacks on the hammer of piano keys
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.440]  So that when they were playing it, it gave a slightly different sound
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.440]  There's lots of things like that
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:20.440]  And if you're into music, you know, I highly recommend the book
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:25.440]  And there's a film actually made, a biopic about him
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.440]  It's just absolutely fascinating
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.440]  So as unusual as his unorthodox methods were
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.440]  There's some highly questionable as well
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.440]  There's one that sticks in my mind
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:41.440]  Where he had a band called The Crying Shames playing on
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:44.440]  And if you've heard it, the song's called Please Stay
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:48.440]  Just listening to it, you're like, oh, there's so much emotion in that record
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.440]  It really is, it's a real tearjerker
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:55.440]  And it's sung with such conviction
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.440]  Of course, it's in the book and it's actually, it's documented in the film
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.440]  He was actually holding a gun to his head
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:10.440]  And without really doing any spoilers, I highly recommend you watch the film
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:14.440]  It didn't really end well for, well, not just for Joe
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.440]  But for plenty of others
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.440]  But really prior to that, you know, anybody and everybody
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.440]  Has kind of rubbed shoulders or brushed with him
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:27.440]  You know, Rod Stewart, Tom Jones
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:30.440]  You know, anybody that's somebody back then
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.440]  There's a good chance
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440]  With the exception of The Beatles, of course
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:37.440]  Because he famously, Brian Epstein sent some demo tapes
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.440]  Demo tapes to him and he rejected them
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.440]  He was just sort of saying, this type of music, it's a flashing pan
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:48.440]  It'll never come to anything
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:51.440]  So really, really, in the show notes on the Sundown Sessions website
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.440]  I'll leave some links and information about that film
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:59.440]  I really, really highly encourage you to watch it
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:02.440]  And if you just, I was a bit of a loose end this afternoon
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.440]  So I thought I'd do a bit of a mashup
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:07.440]  Because if I haven't persuaded you yet
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:14.440]  I'm really, really hoping that this 60-second soundscape, if you like
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:18.440]  That precedes Fabien Del Sol's Rag and Bone Man
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.440]  Will be enough to whet your appetite
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.440]  Hi guys, John Layton
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.440]  You must be the band
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.440]  I haven't been home since Wednesday
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.440]  Can't remember the last time I changed my pants
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.440]  Maryse, Maryse, get closer
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.440]  Topping the US charts for the first time ever
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.440]  It's a British band
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.440]  Two million copies
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.440]  John Peel, New Musical Express
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.440]  Can you get my gold disc in the back here?
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.440]  Selling like hotcakes
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:53.440]  I'm number one again and that's just the start
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:57.440]  This is the summons to appear in the Chieftain of the Magistrates Court
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.440]  There he gets off Billy
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.440]  This whole Mersey Beat thing, it's a foul
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.440]  Play it properly or I'll blow your head off
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.440]  You see what you're doing, you're ruining this for all of us
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.440]  I'm leaving my love letters
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:41.440]  To a ragged bone man
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.440]  Cos I know
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:47.440]  I ain't gonna see you no more
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:55.440]  I'm throwing away my broken heart
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:59.440]  To a man who weighs cars
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:04.440]  You could not break it down like before
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:12.440]  If you should decide to come by
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:16.440]  I'd be pleased to see you first
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:22.440]  Don't think we can start again
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440]  Oh no
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:29.440]  I'm leaving my love letters
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.440]  To a ragged bone man
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.440]  Cos I know
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:39.440]  I ain't gonna see you no more
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:02.440]  If you should decide to come by
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:07.440]  I'd be pleased to see you first
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:12.440]  Don't think we can start again
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.440]  Oh no
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:20.440]  I'm leaving my love letters
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:24.440]  To a ragged bone man
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  Cos I know
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.440]  I ain't gonna see you no more
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.440]  Cos I know
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:38.440]  I ain't gonna see you no more
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.440]  Yes I know
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:47.440]  I ain't gonna see you no more
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:57.440]  That was Fabienne Del Sol from the album On My Mind, a track called Ragged Bone Man
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:04.440]  I truly, truly believe that sounds like something that Joe Meek would have knocked out

[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:11.440]  I got your head off, I put it in my mind
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:16.440]  Said I use your balls when I'm on my TV set
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.440]  I watch TV, I watch TV
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.440]  Oh sister I, I, I will cheat you with my TV set
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:26.440]  Oh baby I, I see you on my radio
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.440]  Oh baby I, I see you on my radio
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.440]  You know I'm waiting for your radio
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:36.440]  I'm waiting for your radio
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:40.440]  AM radio, PM radio
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:44.440]  Since I took you to inside my radio like this
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:07.440]  Oh baby, I see you in my virgin area
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:10.440]  Baby, I put what you keep in my frigid area
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:13.440]  But how amazing is where you're back
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:15.440]  I'm gonna save it tonight
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:17.440]  For the midnight static
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:20.440]  But though it's cold, you won't know
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:24.440]  Cause you're well preserved in my frigid area
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:41.440]  Oh baby, you look so good in my bed at night
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.440]  Yeah baby, you look so good in my bed at night at all
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:48.440]  I could give you a million hugs
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:51.440]  You look so good all covered up in grime
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:53.440]  So I'll miss you there
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.440]  Under your chair, but that's alright
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:58.440]  I'll see you under the rug
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:10.440]  Oh baby, I see you in my TV set
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.440]  Oh baby, I put what you keep in my TV set
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:16.440]  I cut your head off and put it in my TV set
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.440]  I use your hot dogs for dials on my TV set
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.440]  I watch TV, I watch TV
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:26.440]  I say to her, I see you in my TV set
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:29.440]  Oh baby, you look so good in my bed at night
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.440]  Yeah baby, you look so good in my bed at all
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:35.440]  I could give you a million hugs
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.440]  You look so good all covered up in grime
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.440]  So I'll miss you there
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:08.440]  The band, I'm actually quite excited.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:12.440]  They're playing around more in Glasgow on the 4th of July 2024
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:16.440]  and I've managed to secure some tickets, which I'm really pleased about.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:19.440]  This is a cover version of an Otis Redding song.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.440]  It's called Shout Bama Lama.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:23.440]  This is the Detroit Cobras.
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:25.440]  He down Alabama
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:28.440]  I'm shoutin' Bama Lama
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:31.440]  Where in Louisiana
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.440]  Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.440]  Lord, I'm rushin' on my soul
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:40.440]  How many chickens have I stole
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:43.440]  One last night and the night before
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.440]  I'm goin' back to try to get ten or eleven more
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:48.440]  Started gettin' a meter
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:51.440]  I love a chicken, baby
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.440]  Shout Bama Lama
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.440]  Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.440]  In nineteen-seven she was lettin' for the view
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:03.440]  Nineteen, ten for the ten-feet-a-mill
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:06.440]  Nine crept over, drinkin' whiskey and gin
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440]  She fell out, but her tongue stayed in
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.440]  His captain said so
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:13.440]  Ooh, I love my chicken, baby
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:16.440]  Yeah, shoutin' Bama Lama
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.440]  Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:23.440]  Little old monkey told a lie in one day
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.440]  Said, a band little fella comin' down your way
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.440]  Talk about your family, it's a cryin' chain
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.440]  Said your mama's workin' on the chain gang
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:33.440]  She's bustin' bricks now
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:36.440]  Ooh, she do a workin' mom
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:39.440]  Yeah, shoutin' Bama Lama
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.440]  Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:46.440]  Diggin' at the preacher for a prayin' one day
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.440]  Long game of beer comin' down her way
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.440]  Diggin' sad preacher better say a prayer
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:54.440]  Said, oh Lord, I pray I won't kill that bear
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.440]  I gotta roar for it
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:59.440]  Ooh, I gotta make it, baby
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:02.440]  Yeah, shoutin' Bama Lama
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.440]  Well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.440]  He down Alabama
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.440]  Yeah, shoutin' Bama Lama
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:13.440]  Way down Louisiana
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:19.440]  Well, well, well, well, nobody gonna set him down
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:21.440]  Shout Bama Lama. The first time I ever heard that
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:24.440]  I was actually on art school dancing on a Monday evening
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:27.440]  It was a program that my uncle Alastair
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.440]  That ran for a number of years
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.440]  And I would tune in quite religiously
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:35.440]  So it seems quite fit in given that I'm giving him a little name check
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.440]  That I dig deep into the archives
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  And I've managed to fish out a track that is recorded exclusively
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:45.440]  For Alastair
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.440]  It was a band called Becky Becky
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:51.440]  That he championed to no end
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:54.440]  This is Champagne on Christmas Day
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:12.440]  I'm glad it happened
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:15.440]  Nobody could see
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:21.440]  The room is dark
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:25.440]  And I feel giddy
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:32.440]  The only light comes in from under the door
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:36.440]  I'd like a drink
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:40.440]  There's gin on the side
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:45.440]  Champagne's what they give them
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:48.440]  That's what I ought to have
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:51.440]  As you're in home, do me any harm
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.440]  Champagne's what I ought to
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:01.440]  Champagne
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:05.440]  Champagne
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:09.440]  On Christmas Day
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:13.440]  Under the door
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:17.440]  The ray of light comes in
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:23.440]  Like the last thrust of a round of gold
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:30.440]  For everything is blood and doubt
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:35.440]  I'll soon start again
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:40.440]  I've got no doubt
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:44.440]  I thought about being fresh and new
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:47.440]  About starting all over again
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:51.440]  About missing mornings and some days
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:56.440]  And I'll start again all over again
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:00.440]  Champagne
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.440]  All over again
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:05.440]  Champagne
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:09.440]  Champagne
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:13.440]  When I leave, call it
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:22.440]  There you go, Becky Becky
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.440]  And that was Champagne on Christmas Day
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:27.440]  Recorded exclusively for Alastair
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:30.440]  To be played on his art school dancing show
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:34.440]  I'm looking at the time, five minutes
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:37.440]  A text has just actually arrived from Jane and Leith
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:40.440]  Making a request, I'm just queuing that up
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:43.440]  But while I do, I can't quite believe we've only got
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:45.440]  Another five minutes or so left
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.440]  I hope you've enjoyed yourself as much as I have
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:53.440]  And just, I'm actually
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.440]  The show's called Sundown, I'm actually chasing the sun
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.440]  I'm going to be away for the next two weeks
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.440]  But you know, fear not
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.440]  The show is now available on Listen Again
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:05.440]  So you can kind of rinse and repeat
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.440]  You can listen to this show over and again
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.440]  Or the shows that preceded it
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:15.440]  Anyway, from Jane, for Jane and Leith
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:18.440]  This is apparently her favourite
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.440]  This is Simple Minds, I travel
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:27.440]  This is Simple Minds
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:58.440]  Stay building, falling down
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:01.440]  And it all comes falling down
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  Those riches I see on the wall
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:09.440]  Time is clean and standing tall
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:13.440]  Assassin in a hit-and-run
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:16.440]  Easy as I even talk
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:21.440]  Evacuees, refugees
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.440]  Presidents and monarchies
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.440]  Drive around, drive around
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:29.440]  Dirt that's inside pleasure town
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:35.440]  Trags, dudes, low trees
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.440]  Scatches, pops, galleries
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:43.440]  Drive around, drive around
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.440]  Dirt that's inside pleasure town
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.440]  Ooh, ooh, ooh
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.440]  Ooh, ooh, ooh
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.440]  Ooh, ooh, ooh
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  Ooh, ooh, ooh
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.440]  Ooh, ooh, ooh
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.440]  Ooh, ooh, ooh
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:08.440]  Ooh, ooh, ooh
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:10.440]  How's your language, brother?
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.440]  Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.440]  It's time for you and me to march in
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.440]  March along now, march along now
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.440]  Oh, something in the restaurant
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.440]  Airport name, brandy
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:40.440]  Drive around, drive around
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:42.440]  Dirt that's inside pleasure town
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:47.440]  Trags, dudes, low trees
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.440]  Scatches, pops, galleries
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.440]  Drive around, drive around
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.440]  Dirt that's inside pleasure town
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:19.440]  Drive around, drive around
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:21.440]  Dirt that's inside pleasure town
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:27.440]  Trags, dudes, low trees
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.440]  Scatches, pops, galleries
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:52.440]  Europe, how's your language, brother?
