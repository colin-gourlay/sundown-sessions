Tonight, I'm going to address the 1/2 and treat you to the former, with something you will never have thought was the Ants - more on that later... For now I'm focussing on what became a successful writing partnership with Adam Ant. MARCO PIRRONI. Marco has had quite the career in his own right. He played guitar with The Banshees at their first ever gig during 1976 Punk Festival. And that performance at the '100 Club' is the stuff of legend, not least because she recited The Lords Prayer with Marco playing guitar, Sid Vicious playing drums, Steve Severin on bass. Since the Banshees, he's played with the Models, Rema-Rema, Adam Ant, Sinead O'Connor (Jump In The River) and more recently formed The Wolfmen. Core members Chris Constantinou on bass & Chris Hughes (Merrick): Producer, drummer - this was the line up on the Vive Le Rock Album and keeping that in mind this next track would not sound out of place on that album |
