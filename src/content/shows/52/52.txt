It's Wednesday evening here at East Coast FM and the Rockroom returns once again before
I get into that. I really want to thank Ben Dyson really for filling in an Andrew's show
there underranking, dry time show so I'm doing fortunately it's just I had to take back a
step back away from the mic just temporarily so under if you are a listener just want you to
know that I in fact the whole of the East Coast FM family are definitely very much very very
thinking of you right now and yeah back to Ben so Ben was filling very very big choose to
fill Andrew's show and very yeah he doesn't an absolutely splendid job and I'm sure he
wouldn't mind seeing I can't help but feel that he was kind of greasing the wheels for the
Rockroom tonight so I'm a driving tonight we were treated too awesome I was treated too
I know he's a bit of a mermaid character but he had new young shock and I haven't had that
track for years absolutely years I think that was on the mirror ball album can't quite remember
but yeah I haven't heard that and then it was a surprise as well I've never ever heard this before
but if that's Domino then a cover version of the Beatles ladies Madonna and I always think you're
your brave artist if you ever want to cover any Beatles track but be fair play to him he doesn't
pretty good job you know so yeah yeah if that's Domino and Lady Madonna
so yeah I said it's kind of greasing the wheels bit tonight for the next two hours anyway
we're all about the rock room and this is the beauty of rock we cover all sorts of jerks
on our rocker just can cover all sorts of things so tonight we've got some psychedelic rock
at rock punk rock classic rock and believe it or not there is there is a genre called Latin rock
a bit more of that a little bit later for now we're going to kick things off with
something that I know is absolutely what you need
I kind of lose my mind it's not over if you're not you well it's not the ribbons in your have
I don't mind you coming here and wasting it all my time
I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep
doesn't matter where you been as long as it was deep yeah
always knows you're in well you look so fancy I can tell
I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep
I don't mind you coming here at wasting it all my time time
because when you're standing out so near I kind of lose my mind yeah
it's not over if you're not you well it's not the ribbons in your have
I don't mind you coming here and wasting it all my time
I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep
I don't mind you coming here and wasting it all my time
I don't mind you coming here and wasting it all my time
I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep
you're just what I need hey you're just what I need hey the cars and just what I need to
release back in May 1978 and I thought it kicked really things off with the cars because
you know they're they're track drive as kind of synonymous for me anyway with live aid
which can you believe what's 40 years 40 years ago this very week that that happened but
yeah if you're not familiar with the cars back catalog and you're just absolutely nothing wrong
with the album that that was lifted off which was I could see the album cover
I've had a blank moment I was going to say you might think but that was a track and
I don't know what heartbeat city that was it yeah that that's a really good album
but that was kind of just very much of the things but um early car stuff that say just
yeah do check out their back catalog if you like that because it's
there's an abundance of that kind of material really anyway while I was battling on there
a Texas comment from Ray Frey I don't know how you're not sicky here and how you're sicky here and
from his where yeah drew tuned in last night and there for I was going to say regular let's
notice this is what my fourth fifth week now um you may be thinking we're smetched so this isn't
did the rock room but I much just he said hung up his well not entirely hung up his um well
yeah he's hung up on the hook he just hasn't packed his microphone away um and the door is very
very very much way to open for him to come back but it's just due to some commitment so it's
out of the station that he just need to take a step back so hopefully he'll come back but in the
meantime I've got I'm here I've got some very very big shoes to fill and I think I'm actually
put together a really nice playlist and I think probably my partner might not be as uh
amusing as much as uh the music is certainly top drawer and we've got music from Nirvana and
that should qualify that um not the cut cabin variety of Nirvana I'm talking about the original
Nirvana back in the late 60s it must've been like in Parma the trucks the Georgia satellite
and uh as always so so much more so uh unfortunately um and for those this is uh who maybe
didn't tune into the sundown sessions last night I have a shone on a choose the evening
it was a bit chagron on yesterday about how I was looking to do a bit of a jomique special so
as much as I rattled off all the all the artists there um we're not going to feature any jomique
this evening I'm not aware of anything that kind of falls into the to the rock category but
happily happily proved correct did I find if I'm wrong in that uh but for now we're just going to
settle with uh well like I see a bit rock pro rock I'm getting some drop molestia um don't know
um dearie me this is a thing I was absolutely harsh and to get into the studio tonight I'm just
just uh just uh flipping about a little bit let me just put this next track on and get myself
this is uh it's before uh Robert Palmer came across all those women and the and the videos
everybody was all talking about um he released this this is called bag case I love and you
I've gotta find my baby yet I need you to suit my head to my blue heart to it
doctor doctor give me the news I gotta bad case to love in you
don't feel gonna kill my I gotta bad case love you
I'm ready for me
I'm gonna die but if I'm gonna start you think I'm cute
I'll be a little bit shy mama I ain't that kind of guy
doctor doctor give me the news I gotta bad case love in you
don't feel gonna kill my I gotta bad case love you
wow
I know you like it you like it all
I'm gonna die but I'm gonna die but I'm gonna die but I'm gonna die
my love
doctor doctor give me the news I've gotta
That case, I love it, you know
No feels gonna do my, yeah
I gotta, that case, I love it, you know
Bad case of loving you, but I get's Dr. Dr. by Robot Palmer
Actually, I should qualify that
It was an actually by Robot Palmer sitting there, originally
He wasn't the original artist to record that it was a original written and recorded by Moon Martin back in 1978
In Martin's version didn't actually really get much traction, but when a Palmer covered it
And added his signature lick and his kind of polish sound that it became
It became his breakout, and it certainly became the hit, probably it should have been
And it certainly certainly scored very high in the Billboard 100
I can't quite remember how it fared in the UK of the top of my head
And yeah, I'm not sure if it did do very well on me
What we were actually playing here tonight was an American import that I have
It's on the island record label
So yeah picked up a fair so that I may have picked up a fair
Because it's quite scarce to find here, I don't know
You know, I'll just, well, I'll just kind of cue the next song up and before and well, I'll play
I'll actually have a really good, I'm quite curious myself
Oh, good evening, I've had a couple of messages here
I'll get to this Steven's first day
It's his good evening calling
So Steven is the boss, so I'm on my best behavior tonight
I think in that the boss is tuned in so I couldn't, I could not make any mistakes
Yeah, so I really need to thank Steven
And actually he helped
I just had a couple of blanks, I pretty much got my playlist all lined up
And now I was listening to his lunchtime show between 12 and 3
When I was just out of it for it can be out of the, out for a message
It lunchtime there and he played the drugs and I thought
Oh, you know what, I'm going to tell you how we story about the drugs
And there, it was an excuse to play the drugs
So that was it, so that, that, that giving whole that little gap that I didn't have a playlist
I just needed a bit, another 10 minutes, he helped me fill us
So thanks very much for seeing him
Yeah, glad you could join me
Especially if I don't make any mistakes tonight
Yeah, anything on, it was rainbow and all night long
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I know I can't stand another night
On my own
Hey, come with you
That's a lie
Watch your name on your side
I do the one
Watch your side
And I take you home
Wanna tell you
Wanna feel
Wanna make you mine
Surely that's all
Oh
It was all
How long did you power it up
Oh
I've got the�도 you got that hole
All of the zap
All of the dope
I've got the�도 you got that hole
I've got theburnatte
Oh
I've got the�도 you got that hole
You go well, I was playing there, wasn't there, but I've had any doubt, you know, often
talk about these cool stuff, and family, and I truly, as a family, so Stephen, just
at the back of me thanking them for the drugs, you say any glad you could help me out,
but you really did help me out, because I had a severe, severe case of a, of right-touch
block.
I also had a message from Ruth here, and I got, I had to thank a lot of carot and last
night show that I said that there might be something that I'm going to play tonight
that might, uh, can it interest you, so I'm really, really glad you could join me tonight
Ruth.
And I'm also glad to hear it, so maybe a bit, several degrees cooler, where you are today,
down in, down in, down in, I can't remember where it is, it's 86.
Down in, on the other side of the border, let's just say that, let's, keep, keep a kind
of safe, I know you're down in England somewhere, and if you're going to say, I hope the
studio might be too, I'll tell you what, I've actually got the doors open, it is pretty
to us today, I think, there's so much, the studio is so well equipped to really, really,
is it's a, you know, it's quite a professional setup, don't, don't be, don't be filled
thinking what's community radio and what I've yet, it's a, it really is a cracking
we studio, really is, I'm saying cracking we studio, we've got two, uh, but the one
I'm in just now, there's so much gear, and the heat that all these machines generate,
is, uh, it is pretty to us today, um, but, uh, yeah, and two spinal tap fashion, I've got
volume turned up here at number 11, uh, and they're like, uh, the monitors that we have in this,
the station are just absolutely brilliant, this sounds, I hope, I just hope it sounds even half
as good at home as it does in here because, uh, yeah, and here's just absolute dynamite, really,
as in this type of music, as you don't live with for your loud air anyway, so, um, yeah, as much
as it's really, really hot, I don't think, uh, the house is just across, uh, just across,
I'm just looking at the window, I don't think they'd be too thrilled, and, uh, as much as the music
that I'm playing tonight is great, um, they might not quite share the same, the same sentiment
about playing the music here, really, so you're not just, they'll just drive it out, I mean,
I'll only hear from another, around half before feather equal comes, anyway, so, uh, yeah, anyway,
we're, we're, well, yes, that was a rainbow, and, uh, all night long, now if, uh, if you're off
an age, um, that kind of matches me, I suppose, you remember a time that, um, certainly,
down to earth, album, I mean, I still remember quite vividly, um, that, that advertising campaign,
that was around that album, I remember, it was a, it was a globe in it had the rainbow, it was like
in true, 1978, Christopher Reeve, kind of Superman style letters that were coming around
for the back of the earth, and squishing all the way around, and it was a rainbow, you know,
it was just, yeah, it was just, probably quite groundbreaking television at the time, um, but that,
for me, that album, um, I remember going up to the youth club, and just that was on all the time,
when we were playing, uh, peels, you know, whatever it was, you know, or I'm saying playing,
I'm just waving about a stick and just bunching balls about what have you, you know, um,
look like I knew what I was doing, but yeah, I remember that album was just a, uh, on constant play,
um, but they were actually formed, um, a few years prior to that, um, the rainbow, there were,
I guess, so, uh, they were formed, uh, by, uh, Richard Blackmore, who's familiar with the purple
he left it to start his own project, and really, the became known for the kind of the hard rock,
and, uh, like I say, that for me, um, as much as I rotate, line up as well, um,
Tommy Pacston was in, on my show, on my Tuesday show, his sundown sessions, uh, several weeks ago,
and we were chatting, and we were talking at length actually about, uh, Graham Bonnet and the vocalists,
and he was kind of given up. We used to pin his heart off to Rainbow, um, so, uh, that was as much
for him as it was for me, a bit, I mean, I guess it's all material, uh, big country are actually
over in the States, just now, they're touring, so it's highly unlikely they're going to be similar
with the time differences, uh, they're, they're going to be listening, but, uh, if anybody wants to hear,
that interview, it was, like, for me, an answer, both things, I don't mind saying,
it was a very, very proud moment for me because I'm a massive, massive, big country fan,
but it was, uh, he was so, so generous with this time, uh, I mean, we were in here, like, on the mic,
uh, he was easily, uh, I don't know, a bit, I know on the half, it may have been a bit longer,
but off the mic, he was here for just as long, he really was, so generous with his time, lovely,
lovely guy, and, you know, they all say, never ever meet your heroes, but he certainly,
certainly, didn't disappoint, so if, uh, you know, if you want to listen to it again, or if you
want to, you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, I'm absolutely thrilled to say that,
if you go to East FM, East Coast FM.co.uk, and if you just look for the listening again feature,
I'm, you know, as a front-end centre, the interview that I had with Tommy is there to kind of,
kind of listen to it all again, in fact, and it's not just me, there's, uh, there's some other material
there as well, but I guess I'm kind of promoting myself as it was, so encouraged you to check that out.
Now, um, no, that finished kind of massaging my own ego, uh, what would, what would, kind of dealing with
rainbows, if you like, I thought it was a rather tenuous link, um, this is a track called Rainbow Chaser,
from by the band Nirvana, the original Nirvana.
When we left the light, I can't talk to him, and I can't open the door.
When he wants to go, I've been out, how many pages do you draw?
When the rain is so empty, over my desire, I can't talk to him, and I can't open.
I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk
to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, let me ask the questions toenails how manyары
