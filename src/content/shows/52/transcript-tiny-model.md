[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  It's Wednesday evening here at East Coast FM and the Rockroom returns once again before
[00:05.120 --> 00:09.520]  I get into that. I really want to thank Ben Dyson really for filling in an Andrew's show
[00:09.520 --> 00:15.120]  there underranking, dry time show so I'm doing fortunately it's just I had to take back a
[00:15.120 --> 00:20.560]  step back away from the mic just temporarily so under if you are a listener just want you to
[00:20.560 --> 00:26.640]  know that I in fact the whole of the East Coast FM family are definitely very much very very
[00:26.960 --> 00:32.480]  thinking of you right now and yeah back to Ben so Ben was filling very very big choose to
[00:32.480 --> 00:38.160]  fill Andrew's show and very yeah he doesn't an absolutely splendid job and I'm sure he
[00:38.160 --> 00:41.280]  wouldn't mind seeing I can't help but feel that he was kind of greasing the wheels for the
[00:41.280 --> 00:47.040]  Rockroom tonight so I'm a driving tonight we were treated too awesome I was treated too
[00:47.040 --> 00:52.240]  I know he's a bit of a mermaid character but he had new young shock and I haven't had that
[00:52.240 --> 00:58.400]  track for years absolutely years I think that was on the mirror ball album can't quite remember
[00:58.400 --> 01:02.400]  but yeah I haven't heard that and then it was a surprise as well I've never ever heard this before
[01:02.400 --> 01:09.120]  but if that's Domino then a cover version of the Beatles ladies Madonna and I always think you're
[01:09.120 --> 01:16.240]  your brave artist if you ever want to cover any Beatles track but be fair play to him he doesn't
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.720]  pretty good job you know so yeah yeah if that's Domino and Lady Madonna
[01:21.600 --> 01:25.520]  so yeah I said it's kind of greasing the wheels bit tonight for the next two hours anyway
[01:25.520 --> 01:31.520]  we're all about the rock room and this is the beauty of rock we cover all sorts of jerks
[01:31.520 --> 01:36.400]  on our rocker just can cover all sorts of things so tonight we've got some psychedelic rock
[01:36.400 --> 01:42.800]  at rock punk rock classic rock and believe it or not there is there is a genre called Latin rock
[01:42.800 --> 01:47.280]  a bit more of that a little bit later for now we're going to kick things off with
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.400]  something that I know is absolutely what you need
[02:18.240 --> 02:29.120]  I kind of lose my mind it's not over if you're not you well it's not the ribbons in your have
[02:30.320 --> 02:35.600]  I don't mind you coming here and wasting it all my time
[02:48.240 --> 02:58.560]  I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep
[03:00.560 --> 03:06.640]  doesn't matter where you been as long as it was deep yeah
[03:08.160 --> 03:13.600]  always knows you're in well you look so fancy I can tell
[03:13.600 --> 03:20.960]  I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep
[03:43.600 --> 04:01.200]  I don't mind you coming here at wasting it all my time time
[04:02.960 --> 04:08.960]  because when you're standing out so near I kind of lose my mind yeah
[04:08.960 --> 04:17.600]  it's not over if you're not you well it's not the ribbons in your have
[04:17.600 --> 04:23.840]  I don't mind you coming here and wasting it all my time
[04:25.840 --> 04:31.040]  I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep
[04:31.040 --> 04:44.320]  I don't mind you coming here and wasting it all my time
[04:44.320 --> 04:52.320]  I don't mind you coming here and wasting it all my time
[04:52.320 --> 05:06.400]  I don't mind you hanging out and talking in your sleep
[05:06.400 --> 05:33.760]  you're just what I need hey you're just what I need hey the cars and just what I need to
[05:33.760 --> 05:40.240]  release back in May 1978 and I thought it kicked really things off with the cars because
[05:41.360 --> 05:47.040]  you know they're they're track drive as kind of synonymous for me anyway with live aid
[05:47.040 --> 05:54.960]  which can you believe what's 40 years 40 years ago this very week that that happened but
[05:54.960 --> 06:00.240]  yeah if you're not familiar with the cars back catalog and you're just absolutely nothing wrong
[06:00.240 --> 06:07.520]  with the album that that was lifted off which was I could see the album cover
[06:07.520 --> 06:12.640]  I've had a blank moment I was going to say you might think but that was a track and
[06:12.640 --> 06:18.240]  I don't know what heartbeat city that was it yeah that that's a really good album
[06:18.240 --> 06:24.240]  but that was kind of just very much of the things but um early car stuff that say just
[06:24.240 --> 06:28.560]  yeah do check out their back catalog if you like that because it's
[06:29.280 --> 06:34.000]  there's an abundance of that kind of material really anyway while I was battling on there
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.480]  a Texas comment from Ray Frey I don't know how you're not sicky here and how you're sicky here and
[06:38.480 --> 06:43.360]  from his where yeah drew tuned in last night and there for I was going to say regular let's
[06:43.360 --> 06:50.000]  notice this is what my fourth fifth week now um you may be thinking we're smetched so this isn't
[06:50.000 --> 06:57.600]  did the rock room but I much just he said hung up his well not entirely hung up his um well
[06:57.600 --> 07:02.320]  yeah he's hung up on the hook he just hasn't packed his microphone away um and the door is very
[07:02.320 --> 07:07.200]  very very much way to open for him to come back but it's just due to some commitment so it's
[07:07.200 --> 07:13.200]  out of the station that he just need to take a step back so hopefully he'll come back but in the
[07:13.200 --> 07:18.720]  meantime I've got I'm here I've got some very very big shoes to fill and I think I'm actually
[07:18.720 --> 07:25.200]  put together a really nice playlist and I think probably my partner might not be as uh
[07:25.200 --> 07:30.720]  amusing as much as uh the music is certainly top drawer and we've got music from Nirvana and
[07:30.720 --> 07:36.880]  that should qualify that um not the cut cabin variety of Nirvana I'm talking about the original
[07:36.880 --> 07:42.720]  Nirvana back in the late 60s it must've been like in Parma the trucks the Georgia satellite
[07:42.800 --> 07:51.440]  and uh as always so so much more so uh unfortunately um and for those this is uh who maybe
[07:51.440 --> 07:55.440]  didn't tune into the sundown sessions last night I have a shone on a choose the evening
[07:55.440 --> 08:00.480]  it was a bit chagron on yesterday about how I was looking to do a bit of a jomique special so
[08:00.480 --> 08:06.320]  as much as I rattled off all the all the artists there um we're not going to feature any jomique
[08:06.320 --> 08:12.160]  this evening I'm not aware of anything that kind of falls into the to the rock category but
[08:12.240 --> 08:17.520]  happily happily proved correct did I find if I'm wrong in that uh but for now we're just going to
[08:17.520 --> 08:25.920]  settle with uh well like I see a bit rock pro rock I'm getting some drop molestia um don't know
[08:25.920 --> 08:32.560]  um dearie me this is a thing I was absolutely harsh and to get into the studio tonight I'm just
[08:32.560 --> 08:37.760]  just uh just uh flipping about a little bit let me just put this next track on and get myself
[08:38.640 --> 08:44.480]  this is uh it's before uh Robert Palmer came across all those women and the and the videos
[08:44.480 --> 08:48.800]  everybody was all talking about um he released this this is called bag case I love and you
[09:08.720 --> 09:26.240]  I've gotta find my baby yet I need you to suit my head to my blue heart to it

[12:01.520 --> 12:05.720]  Bad case of loving you, but I get's Dr. Dr. by Robot Palmer
[12:05.720 --> 12:07.720]  Actually, I should qualify that
[12:07.720 --> 12:11.320]  It was an actually by Robot Palmer sitting there, originally
[12:11.320 --> 12:18.520]  He wasn't the original artist to record that it was a original written and recorded by Moon Martin back in 1978
[12:18.520 --> 12:23.520]  In Martin's version didn't actually really get much traction, but when a Palmer covered it
[12:23.520 --> 12:27.520]  And added his signature lick and his kind of polish sound that it became
[12:27.520 --> 12:31.520]  It became his breakout, and it certainly became the hit, probably it should have been
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.320]  And it certainly certainly scored very high in the Billboard 100
[12:36.320 --> 12:40.720]  I can't quite remember how it fared in the UK of the top of my head
[12:40.720 --> 12:45.120]  And yeah, I'm not sure if it did do very well on me
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.320]  What we were actually playing here tonight was an American import that I have
[12:48.320 --> 12:50.320]  It's on the island record label
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.520]  So yeah picked up a fair so that I may have picked up a fair
[12:54.520 --> 12:58.320]  Because it's quite scarce to find here, I don't know
[12:59.120 --> 13:03.720]  You know, I'll just, well, I'll just kind of cue the next song up and before and well, I'll play
[13:03.720 --> 13:06.520]  I'll actually have a really good, I'm quite curious myself
[13:07.720 --> 13:10.720]  Oh, good evening, I've had a couple of messages here
[13:10.720 --> 13:13.720]  I'll get to this Steven's first day
[13:13.720 --> 13:14.920]  It's his good evening calling
[13:14.920 --> 13:18.320]  So Steven is the boss, so I'm on my best behavior tonight
[13:19.320 --> 13:24.720]  I think in that the boss is tuned in so I couldn't, I could not make any mistakes
[13:24.720 --> 13:27.320]  Yeah, so I really need to thank Steven
[13:27.320 --> 13:28.520]  And actually he helped
[13:30.520 --> 13:34.520]  I just had a couple of blanks, I pretty much got my playlist all lined up
[13:34.520 --> 13:37.920]  And now I was listening to his lunchtime show between 12 and 3
[13:37.920 --> 13:41.520]  When I was just out of it for it can be out of the, out for a message
[13:41.520 --> 13:43.920]  It lunchtime there and he played the drugs and I thought
[13:43.920 --> 13:47.920]  Oh, you know what, I'm going to tell you how we story about the drugs
[13:47.920 --> 13:50.320]  And there, it was an excuse to play the drugs
[13:50.320 --> 13:55.120]  So that was it, so that, that, that giving whole that little gap that I didn't have a playlist
[13:55.120 --> 13:58.720]  I just needed a bit, another 10 minutes, he helped me fill us
[13:58.720 --> 14:00.720]  So thanks very much for seeing him
[14:00.720 --> 14:02.720]  Yeah, glad you could join me

[17:54.120 --> 17:58.840]  You go well, I was playing there, wasn't there, but I've had any doubt, you know, often
[17:58.840 --> 18:03.000]  talk about these cool stuff, and family, and I truly, as a family, so Stephen, just
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.640]  at the back of me thanking them for the drugs, you say any glad you could help me out,
[18:06.640 --> 18:12.920]  but you really did help me out, because I had a severe, severe case of a, of right-touch
[18:12.920 --> 18:13.920]  block.
[18:13.920 --> 18:17.980]  I also had a message from Ruth here, and I got, I had to thank a lot of carot and last
[18:17.980 --> 18:22.680]  night show that I said that there might be something that I'm going to play tonight
[18:22.680 --> 18:28.200]  that might, uh, can it interest you, so I'm really, really glad you could join me tonight
[18:28.200 --> 18:29.200]  Ruth.
[18:29.200 --> 18:33.200]  And I'm also glad to hear it, so maybe a bit, several degrees cooler, where you are today,
[18:33.200 --> 18:39.280]  down in, down in, down in, I can't remember where it is, it's 86.
[18:39.280 --> 18:43.880]  Down in, on the other side of the border, let's just say that, let's, keep, keep a kind
[18:43.880 --> 18:48.560]  of safe, I know you're down in England somewhere, and if you're going to say, I hope the
[18:48.560 --> 18:52.520]  studio might be too, I'll tell you what, I've actually got the doors open, it is pretty
[18:52.520 --> 18:57.200]  to us today, I think, there's so much, the studio is so well equipped to really, really,
[18:57.200 --> 19:01.560]  is it's a, you know, it's quite a professional setup, don't, don't be, don't be filled
[19:01.560 --> 19:04.880]  thinking what's community radio and what I've yet, it's a, it really is a cracking
[19:04.880 --> 19:08.800]  we studio, really is, I'm saying cracking we studio, we've got two, uh, but the one
[19:08.800 --> 19:12.800]  I'm in just now, there's so much gear, and the heat that all these machines generate,
[19:12.800 --> 19:17.520]  is, uh, it is pretty to us today, um, but, uh, yeah, and two spinal tap fashion, I've got
[19:17.600 --> 19:23.120]  volume turned up here at number 11, uh, and they're like, uh, the monitors that we have in this,
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.840]  the station are just absolutely brilliant, this sounds, I hope, I just hope it sounds even half
[19:27.840 --> 19:34.080]  as good at home as it does in here because, uh, yeah, and here's just absolute dynamite, really,
[19:34.080 --> 19:38.480]  as in this type of music, as you don't live with for your loud air anyway, so, um, yeah, as much
[19:38.480 --> 19:43.840]  as it's really, really hot, I don't think, uh, the house is just across, uh, just across,
[19:44.240 --> 19:49.040]  I'm just looking at the window, I don't think they'd be too thrilled, and, uh, as much as the music
[19:49.040 --> 19:54.320]  that I'm playing tonight is great, um, they might not quite share the same, the same sentiment
[19:54.320 --> 19:58.400]  about playing the music here, really, so you're not just, they'll just drive it out, I mean,
[19:58.400 --> 20:04.000]  I'll only hear from another, around half before feather equal comes, anyway, so, uh, yeah, anyway,
[20:04.000 --> 20:11.120]  we're, we're, well, yes, that was a rainbow, and, uh, all night long, now if, uh, if you're off
[20:11.120 --> 20:16.480]  an age, um, that kind of matches me, I suppose, you remember a time that, um, certainly,
[20:17.360 --> 20:22.160]  down to earth, album, I mean, I still remember quite vividly, um, that, that advertising campaign,
[20:22.720 --> 20:26.640]  that was around that album, I remember, it was a, it was a globe in it had the rainbow, it was like
[20:26.640 --> 20:32.560]  in true, 1978, Christopher Reeve, kind of Superman style letters that were coming around
[20:32.560 --> 20:37.040]  for the back of the earth, and squishing all the way around, and it was a rainbow, you know,
[20:37.040 --> 20:42.800]  it was just, yeah, it was just, probably quite groundbreaking television at the time, um, but that,
[20:42.800 --> 20:48.480]  for me, that album, um, I remember going up to the youth club, and just that was on all the time,
[20:48.480 --> 20:53.120]  when we were playing, uh, peels, you know, whatever it was, you know, or I'm saying playing,
[20:53.120 --> 20:57.600]  I'm just waving about a stick and just bunching balls about what have you, you know, um,
[20:57.600 --> 21:03.360]  look like I knew what I was doing, but yeah, I remember that album was just a, uh, on constant play,
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.400]  um, but they were actually formed, um, a few years prior to that, um, the rainbow, there were,
[21:09.280 --> 21:14.160]  I guess, so, uh, they were formed, uh, by, uh, Richard Blackmore, who's familiar with the purple
[21:14.160 --> 21:19.440]  he left it to start his own project, and really, the became known for the kind of the hard rock,
[21:19.440 --> 21:25.040]  and, uh, like I say, that for me, um, as much as I rotate, line up as well, um,
[21:26.240 --> 21:31.760]  Tommy Pacston was in, on my show, on my Tuesday show, his sundown sessions, uh, several weeks ago,
[21:31.840 --> 21:36.720]  and we were chatting, and we were talking at length actually about, uh, Graham Bonnet and the vocalists,
[21:36.720 --> 21:43.520]  and he was kind of given up. We used to pin his heart off to Rainbow, um, so, uh, that was as much
[21:43.520 --> 21:48.400]  for him as it was for me, a bit, I mean, I guess it's all material, uh, big country are actually
[21:48.400 --> 21:52.880]  over in the States, just now, they're touring, so it's highly unlikely they're going to be similar
[21:52.880 --> 21:57.760]  with the time differences, uh, they're, they're going to be listening, but, uh, if anybody wants to hear,
[21:58.160 --> 22:02.160]  that interview, it was, like, for me, an answer, both things, I don't mind saying,
[22:02.160 --> 22:06.400]  it was a very, very proud moment for me because I'm a massive, massive, big country fan,
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.760]  but it was, uh, he was so, so generous with this time, uh, I mean, we were in here, like, on the mic,
[22:13.760 --> 22:20.320]  uh, he was easily, uh, I don't know, a bit, I know on the half, it may have been a bit longer,
[22:20.320 --> 22:24.960]  but off the mic, he was here for just as long, he really was, so generous with his time, lovely,
[22:24.960 --> 22:30.160]  lovely guy, and, you know, they all say, never ever meet your heroes, but he certainly,
[22:30.160 --> 22:35.040]  certainly, didn't disappoint, so if, uh, you know, if you want to listen to it again, or if you
[22:35.040 --> 22:39.840]  want to, you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, I'm absolutely thrilled to say that,
[22:41.040 --> 22:46.800]  if you go to East FM, East Coast FM.co.uk, and if you just look for the listening again feature,
[22:46.800 --> 22:53.360]  I'm, you know, as a front-end centre, the interview that I had with Tommy is there to kind of,
[22:53.360 --> 22:57.680]  kind of listen to it all again, in fact, and it's not just me, there's, uh, there's some other material
[22:57.680 --> 23:03.280]  there as well, but I guess I'm kind of promoting myself as it was, so encouraged you to check that out.
[23:04.720 --> 23:10.560]  Now, um, no, that finished kind of massaging my own ego, uh, what would, what would, kind of dealing with
[23:10.560 --> 23:16.160]  rainbows, if you like, I thought it was a rather tenuous link, um, this is a track called Rainbow Chaser,
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.080]  from by the band Nirvana, the original Nirvana.
[23:46.160 --> 23:53.200]  When we left the light, I can't talk to him, and I can't open the door.
[23:55.200 --> 24:00.560]  When he wants to go, I've been out, how many pages do you draw?
[24:00.560 --> 24:11.200]  When the rain is so empty, over my desire, I can't talk to him, and I can't open.
[24:16.160 --> 24:46.160]  I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to him, I can't talk
