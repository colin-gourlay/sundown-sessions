[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  It's Wednesday evening, here at East Coast FM, and that can mean only one thing for the next two hours.
[00:06.000 --> 00:13.000]  Anyway, we'll be playing some of the finest rock tunes, rock tunes, rock music.
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  It's certainly a great mat on tables for the last few years.
[00:18.000 --> 00:26.000]  But before a bit of a serious point, really, before I get into all the music, I need to thank Andrew really for,
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.000]  well, there's a number of reasons why I really need to thank him.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.000]  First of all, thank him for, you know, this afternoon, he's a great time shopping,
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  but thank you as well for actually sharing these memories.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  These personal memories, just grown up as a child, you know, he's hacking back to me,
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  you know, when his mum's in muscle bar before moving to long-nidry, and what I have here,
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.000]  it was really touched.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  And for those that don't know, Andrew's mum passed away just ten days ago,
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  and this was, he was wanting to come back to the, to do a really special show for the day,
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  because we'd have been sadly, we'd have been our birthday today, so I think,
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  thank you for, like I say, so many reasons, I mean, it was very brave.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  I was listening to the opening of the show, and I just astonished that he managed to keep it together.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  He'd done an absolutely wonderful job, and in fact, just during the handover there,
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  he did say that, you know, he hoped he'd done his mum proud,
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  and then finishing up there with the illnesses, the wonder of you, and you know,
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  goodness, I feel like I need some tissues here, you know, it's hard not to be affected,
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.000]  but I've absolutely no doubt, my mind that he did do his mum absolutely proud,
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  and he should be proud of himself actually for coming into the day, and actually doing that,
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  that took quite a bit of courage to do, and, like I say, thank you again for, for sharing those stories.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  With, with not just these close to FM family, but just the wider community, everybody out there listening,
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  because I do know as well, like I say, I mean, I was working this afternoon,
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  and I caught, for the most part, the majority of the show, but I'm sure it got a lot of comfort
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  from all the text messages that were coming into the studio, and it just really shows how
[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  they thought Andrew is, and, yeah, it's nice, it kind of validate, he has well thought of,
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.000]  but it's nice with all these messages coming in, it kind of somewhat validates that.
[02:28.000 --> 02:36.000]  Right, yeah, so business is usual, back to the sundown sessions, the rock edition, if you will,
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  like I say, for the next two hours, we're going to be playing some absolute brilliant,
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  let's go see, rock tunes, yeah, things that fall under the rock genre,
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  and the rock genre has so many sub-genres, basically means I can go cut blinds,
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  I can basically play literally everything and get away with it and see it's rock,
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  and what better we need to start off with this.
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  This is a cover version, it was actually, I remember Hendrix experience track,
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  but this is a by Steven Ivonne, this is a called Come On Part 3.

[07:57.500 --> 08:01.420]  on the album that proceeded that Texas floods released back in 1984.
[08:01.420 --> 08:02.700]  No, well, that was playing there.
[08:02.700 --> 08:10.700]  We've actually had a couple of texts coming in and actually, you know, I'll read them out
[08:10.700 --> 08:18.220]  because Andrew's still here, he's a next door, he's keeping an eye on my bike, I say
[08:18.220 --> 08:23.900]  go don't do this to you. I'm just kind of thinking he's maybe listening to the show as
[08:23.900 --> 08:29.420]  well, or maybe he's preparing for the next-again show, but uh, so at the first one, like I
[08:29.420 --> 08:33.260]  say, we'll just walk through them, so we're ready. Good evening, Colin. How are you doing? I'm doing
[08:33.260 --> 08:37.820]  really well, Ray. Thanks so much for joining me. You're in for a real treat tonight,
[08:37.820 --> 08:43.580]  got some terrific music. Um, well, I guess I say that everything don't know. And uh, that was
[08:43.580 --> 08:50.220]  followed by Mark, uh, no apologies, Mark, uh, I'm not quite got your second name, it's uh, Mark Mc
[08:50.300 --> 08:56.300]  something. I don't know, it's uh, the, uh, your name's been truncated, unfortunately, but uh, but
[08:56.300 --> 09:03.340]  you see, well done Andrew, we are all thinking of you. And there, uh, and uh, Lorraine, uh,
[09:03.340 --> 09:09.580]  our very own Lorraine has said evening, Colin, Andrew, yeah, absolutely. Um, evening, Colin,
[09:09.580 --> 09:14.860]  Andrew is so brave. I'm in Brits after it and Lubby, uh, of course, Lubby's his mom,
[09:15.100 --> 09:21.500]  Lubby would be proud of him. And I've absolutely no doubt about that. Um, it was, uh, it was
[09:21.500 --> 09:27.420]  so brave, you know, I've just uh, couldn't agree more, Lorraine. Uh, me, he done, done an absolutely
[09:27.420 --> 09:31.900]  amazing job. And I hope in some ways it was, uh, somewhat cathartic for him, because I,
[09:31.900 --> 09:35.900]  I imagine he's, I'm seeing he's sitting next door. I can't quite see there's, there's so many
[09:35.900 --> 09:41.260]  more of a thousand years, but, um, you know, I imagine he's probably kind of decompressing
[09:41.260 --> 09:45.660]  if you are, because, uh, you know, he's kind of real living a lot of his own past. There's
[09:45.660 --> 09:51.020]  bellies, he's mums and recouping, uh, all the happy days, uh, of his childhood and, and what
[09:51.020 --> 09:55.260]  I have here when he's talking about his grandparents and everything. So, uh, yeah, good on
[09:55.260 --> 10:00.060]  our laundry is good on our laundry, good on our laundry, doesn't really really well. And, uh,
[10:00.060 --> 10:03.980]  like I say, it's nice that all these messages coming in, I'm sure he's, he's listening
[10:03.980 --> 10:08.460]  next door and he can hear them. And if he's not, uh, when the next track is playing, I'll make
[10:08.540 --> 10:16.540]  a point of grabbing him. Pull him through the monitor so you can see that we are all very, very
[10:16.540 --> 10:21.580]  much behind him. Um, so yeah, back to the music, I was, I kind of want to correct myself here
[10:21.580 --> 10:26.460]  when I'm saying it as a common part three of us are steving, uh, at Jimmy Hendrix cover. That's
[10:26.460 --> 10:32.140]  not actually quite correct. Um, it's said the, the blues button, if you like, was very much
[10:32.220 --> 10:38.940]  passed down, um, from one musician to another, it was originally, uh, originally, uh, it was a
[10:38.940 --> 10:44.940]  track, uh, by Earl King, it was called Come On, let the good times roll. And, uh, Jimmy,
[10:44.940 --> 10:50.620]  Jimmy Hendrix, um, I think it was on Axis Bolder's Love, um, he's, uh, second album, the
[10:50.620 --> 10:56.540]  Jimmy Hendrix experience, um, it was called Come On Part One. And stevary divorce, stevary
[10:57.100 --> 11:01.900]  version that we heard there, like I say, that was Come On Part Three. So, a lot of it wasn't the
[11:01.900 --> 11:09.740]  same title, um, and it's not a direct cover, or if you like it, certainly, I would say it's a continuation,
[11:09.740 --> 11:14.140]  and it's a certainly, in order to, to Jimmy Hendrix. And if you've ever seen, I've talked about it
[11:14.140 --> 11:18.540]  this before, and a previous show, uh, if you've not seen it, because you need to check it out, because
[11:18.540 --> 11:24.700]  it's just, it's just, it's just, it's in what that man can do with the guitar, um, um, yeah, if you,
[11:24.780 --> 11:30.700]  if you look for, I'm sure it'll be on YouTube now. It's so sold. I mean, I've got it on DVD, um, stevary
[11:30.700 --> 11:36.140]  divorce, and double travel live at the El McCambo. And, uh, it must have been a period when
[11:36.140 --> 11:42.540]  it was promote now, bomb Texas flood, uh, but like I say, back in 1984, because, uh, the, the tracks from
[11:42.540 --> 11:48.220]  that album feature quite heavily, not exclusively, um, big, quite heavily. And there's an absolutely
[11:48.220 --> 11:54.220]  beautiful, uh, it's what's just watching it for this, uh, beautiful track called Lenny, uh, which was, uh,
[11:54.380 --> 12:00.220]  was a, it's an instrumental track, um, but it, it wrote that, uh, dedicated to his wife.
[12:01.820 --> 12:07.660]  Yeah, so, uh, anyway, without much further ado, I'm just, uh, Andrew's kind of, uh, I don't know
[12:07.660 --> 12:11.500]  if he's waving at me or something like that. I'll just think the next track on, we'll see if,
[12:11.500 --> 12:15.500]  see what he's after, I mean, he's, like, he's looking from a bit of, a bit of my attention.
[12:24.700 --> 12:26.700]  Yeah.
[12:30.700 --> 12:36.140]  Look at all the good times, won't see the time,
[12:37.580 --> 12:42.300]  because I'm the man, show you around.
[12:44.460 --> 12:48.940]  It's not in talks, I want to hear it sing.
[12:48.940 --> 12:56.540]  If you've got the redness, then I'll sing,
[12:56.540 --> 13:03.500]  song is a crisis, like, as long as the virus is right,
[13:03.580 --> 13:13.900]  it got no bad choice, you'd ask, then, uh,
[13:21.900 --> 13:30.380]  back from the car game, the ace in the hole, the speaker on the right hand,
[13:31.340 --> 13:42.460]  and then my soul's, I've seen the movie and I've ran the book,
[13:42.460 --> 13:54.300]  I don't need no second rule, it's almost a crisis, right? It's almost a crisis, right?
[13:54.300 --> 13:57.580]  It's almost a crisis, like, as long as the virus is right,
[13:57.580 --> 14:05.580]  you'd ask, then, uh, you'd ask, then, uh, you'd just ask, you'd ask,
[14:14.300 --> 14:19.100]  then, uh, you'd ask, then, uh, you'd just ask, you'd ask,
[14:24.300 --> 14:54.220]  you'd ask, then, uh, okay, let's sort this out,
[14:54.300 --> 14:57.300]  As long as the five sits right
[14:57.300 --> 15:01.300]  As long as the five sits right
[15:01.300 --> 15:04.300]  As long as the five sits right
[15:04.300 --> 15:06.300]  You've got more cash
[15:06.300 --> 15:08.300]  You've got enough cash
[15:12.300 --> 15:14.300]  You've got no cash
[15:14.300 --> 15:16.300]  You've got enough cash
[15:19.300 --> 15:21.300]  You've got enough cash
[15:21.300 --> 15:23.300]  You've got enough cash
[15:25.300 --> 15:28.300]  You've got enough cash
[15:28.300 --> 15:29.300]  You've got enough cash
[15:29.300 --> 15:30.300]  You've got enough cash
[15:30.300 --> 15:32.300]  You've got enough cash
[15:32.300 --> 15:33.300]  As long as the price is right
[15:33.300 --> 15:34.300]  Just about that was planned
[15:34.300 --> 15:35.300]  They were so underypopt
[15:35.300 --> 15:36.300]  You've just been away
[15:36.300 --> 15:39.300]  Because it was quite keen to see the extent
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.300]  There were coming in
[15:40.300 --> 15:43.300]  But it was just an exaggerating attention
[15:43.300 --> 15:45.300]  Too much a lot more to a pop-in
[15:45.300 --> 15:47.300]  So here it's a decent next story
[15:47.300 --> 15:49.300]  He's listening to the show
[15:49.300 --> 15:51.300]  And he's just doing some bits and pieces
[15:51.300 --> 15:53.300]  So he's going to be sticking around
[15:53.300 --> 15:59.620]  So, you know if you want to send the message then feel free to do so you can text a studio on
[16:03.220 --> 16:08.180]  Where does it or there is right do you know I don't know how many times I've read this number
[16:08.180 --> 16:14.580]  I've just not committed it to memory. Okay, so I just just need my wee kind of flyer here
[16:15.060 --> 16:21.220]  So you can text a studio on 0 7 8 35 90 20 30 and
[16:21.940 --> 16:25.860]  Yeah, get messages if you want to hear your name and then you do I'm more than happy to
[16:26.660 --> 16:29.780]  Can you read that out and you know, well quite a jump act
[16:30.740 --> 16:35.300]  Playless this evening, but if there's something that you're absolutely anchoring to hear
[16:36.020 --> 16:40.500]  And who knows who knows we might just have a wee space slot that I could maybe
[16:40.740 --> 16:43.940]  shoehorn something and but like like I say we'll just kind of
[16:44.740 --> 16:49.060]  Kind of suck and see if here we go on again this is what it's already 20 past six
[16:49.620 --> 16:52.900]  Should should be plain add about friend about now, but uh
[16:53.700 --> 16:58.820]  But I had planned to play this I heard the ad about so just uh on the other side of this I was coupon track
[16:58.820 --> 17:00.820]  Uh, well we've had the ad about
[17:10.580 --> 17:12.580]  I
[17:16.820 --> 17:20.820]  Love the dead before they're cool
[17:23.460 --> 17:27.220]  The blue and flesh or meat or
[17:30.740 --> 17:34.740]  Cadever eyes upon me see
[17:36.660 --> 17:38.660]  Nothing
[17:40.500 --> 17:42.500]  You
[17:52.020 --> 17:54.260]  I love the dead before their eyes
[17:55.300 --> 17:57.300]  No farewells no advice
[17:58.500 --> 18:01.700]  I never even knew you're not running face
[18:05.300 --> 18:09.300]  Well friends and lovers more in your silly grave
[18:10.500 --> 18:12.500]  I have other uses for you darling
[18:40.500 --> 18:42.500]  Do

[26:42.820 --> 26:49.060]  We've just just before the adverts there, we had some Alice Cooper, and I'll tell you
[26:49.060 --> 26:54.700]  to myself, I opted for that track, I treated myself fairly recently, to a copy of a billion
[26:54.700 --> 26:55.700]  dollar babies.
[26:55.700 --> 27:03.340]  It's been a huge record company, it's been a no-how to get the money out of my pockets.
[27:03.340 --> 27:08.540]  I mean, I don't know how many copies of that album, billion dollar babies are already, but
[27:08.540 --> 27:16.260]  kind of remastered, repackaged, and I was out in 180 grand, but I mean, it is a thing
[27:16.260 --> 27:25.700]  of beauty, it's just much like the original, and it's a beautiful album, it's like Crocodile
[27:25.700 --> 27:30.380]  skin, I feel like, although it's a bit so you can describe it, but it's really really nice
[27:30.380 --> 27:35.540]  and it's a great album, and yeah, so then that was followed by adverts and then on the other
[27:35.540 --> 27:41.500]  side of that, unless, so if you're tuned into the show this evening, rock is obviously
[27:41.500 --> 27:49.300]  your jam, so I don't need to tell you unless you've been living on the moon, or some
[27:49.300 --> 27:56.300]  other exotic place, there was a big, big event, then I'm burning up at the weekend there, of
[27:56.300 --> 28:04.940]  course talking about the last ever Black Sabbath performance, we were at Aussie Tuk-to-Stage
[28:05.020 --> 28:11.700]  Alarmouth, Tony Omey, and crew, but it was a bit more than just Black Sabbath, I've looked
[28:11.700 --> 28:17.700]  at the rundown of the entire day, so there was like a lot of bands who have been, I
[28:17.700 --> 28:24.860]  was quite affected, influenced rather, influenced by Sabbath, they were invited to perform
[28:24.860 --> 28:30.700]  and there was goodness, so at the top of my head, it's like a who's who of em, if it
[28:30.700 --> 28:36.020]  air guitars, you're a thing, it's a who's who, notably for me, no no bit in court, had
[28:36.020 --> 28:40.380]  tonned up, he was playing out in it all star band, and if you're tuned in a few weeks
[28:40.380 --> 28:50.020]  ago, you will obviously recall that I did actually chat about the time that I met him
[28:50.020 --> 28:56.820]  and we went backstage and yeah, my son, we got the autographs, autographs, set list, some
[28:56.820 --> 29:03.260]  photos, and he was a lovely, lovely guy, and without the whole story, he was just really
[29:03.260 --> 29:09.100]  really keen on how we got the backstage things, and actually it happened to catch my son
[29:09.100 --> 29:14.660]  who was very young at the time, I think he was maybe in the first seven, first year, you
[29:14.660 --> 29:21.260]  know he's sent the pre-teen years anyway, but it was a bit concerned about I'm getting
[29:21.260 --> 29:27.100]  crushed and he clocked him in the crowding, A and Vita Tamovar, and yes, almost on the
[29:27.100 --> 29:34.140]  year, you got to set up on the side of the stage, for the remainder of the gig, and just
[29:34.140 --> 29:41.340]  so that I could meet up with him, I got backstage passes, and we met up in he was, it wasn't
[29:41.340 --> 29:47.820]  just about to save me, but why was that I guess, he was so generous this time, he was just
[29:47.820 --> 29:54.980]  kind of really thrilled that it's like the next-again generation, if you like, of fans,
[29:54.980 --> 29:59.980]  that are coming along, it's not just like him, olden, bold people like myself that are
[29:59.980 --> 30:06.220]  going along, it's like a new fans, if you like, and it was equally thrilled to learn
[30:06.220 --> 30:11.900]  that Liam at the time anyway, he was learning to play the guitar, and he's just given him
[30:11.980 --> 30:18.220]  all the encouragement you could ever ask for, I love the lovely guy, and yes, he was playing
[30:18.220 --> 30:25.980]  the early old star band, goodness of gone, gone a little bit blank, guns and roses, I'm not
[30:25.980 --> 30:31.980]  quite sure if it was the entire original line, I'm certainly actual rose was performing slash
[30:31.980 --> 30:38.380]  was there, but I don't know, but is it Stradlin and what have you, but like for me, a real
[30:38.460 --> 30:46.300]  notable appearance slash performance was a Metallica, they played, they played, I need to,
[30:46.300 --> 30:51.340]  actually, I was not the gig, I was down in the environment, you can, they'll come to that shortly,
[30:52.300 --> 30:57.660]  but just kind of after the fact that I was chatting to somebody in a bar and he was, he was talking
[30:57.660 --> 31:04.780]  about Metallica and they said, the play battery, which is a really really early, it's a very,
[31:05.740 --> 31:10.460]  it's almost like thrashing, it was not really thrashing metal, but I'm just, because I can't
[31:10.460 --> 31:14.780]  think of another, another tie-top, I'm just going to say it's a bit more of a kind of thrashing metal
[31:14.780 --> 31:21.580]  rather than the kind of later stuff, and there were the few other tracks on that, I had a 30 minute
[31:21.580 --> 31:26.300]  set, as did, because there were so, so many bands, a lot of them, there was a lot of bands at a
[31:26.300 --> 31:34.700]  period, but they all had a quite short set, but they wrapped up with a cover version of a black
[31:34.700 --> 31:43.740]  Sabbath song, but tonight I'm going to play a track from really, I don't know if it might go to
[31:43.740 --> 31:50.460]  album, I certainly play it a lot, it's from what became known as the black album, this is a second track
[31:50.460 --> 32:14.460]  on that album, this is called Sad Butte True.
[32:20.460 --> 32:50.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[32:50.460 --> 33:20.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[33:20.460 --> 33:50.460]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[36:51.460 --> 36:55.460]  I'm inside open your eyes
[36:55.460 --> 36:59.460]  I'm your, oh
[36:59.460 --> 37:05.460]  That's what true
[37:14.460 --> 37:17.460]  Yo, I was actually playing the air drums here
[37:17.460 --> 37:21.460]  I was a thing until until I was just sitting here listening to it
[37:21.460 --> 37:25.460]  I'm absolutely terrific track and really if there was
[37:25.460 --> 37:29.460]  If there was ever an album that needed to be kind of
[37:29.460 --> 37:31.460]  Framed as Metallica for beginners
[37:31.460 --> 37:33.460]  That is definitely there
[37:33.460 --> 37:35.460]  They go to album for me anyway
[37:35.460 --> 37:37.460]  And that's the album
[37:37.460 --> 37:39.460]  You really need to check out fast
[37:39.460 --> 37:41.460]  Because that means they've got
[37:41.460 --> 37:43.460]  A score, I'm scoring albums
[37:43.460 --> 37:45.460]  I've got a lot of great tracks
[37:45.460 --> 37:47.460]  Great tracks, great albums
[37:47.460 --> 37:49.460]  But like for me that is like
[37:49.460 --> 37:51.460]  Consistent through
[37:51.460 --> 37:53.460]  Really inter-sad man
[37:53.460 --> 37:55.460]  Nothing else matters
[37:55.460 --> 37:57.460]  That takes on a bit of a special menu
[37:57.460 --> 37:59.460]  And really because
[37:59.460 --> 38:01.460]  My son that was the first song he learned
[38:01.460 --> 38:03.460]  to play in the guitar actually
[38:03.460 --> 38:05.460]  And that was me and I thought that set
[38:05.460 --> 38:07.460]  I've cracked that not
[38:07.460 --> 38:09.460]  He's going to
[38:09.460 --> 38:11.460]  He's going to get these guitars that I have
[38:11.460 --> 38:13.460]  They're all going to get people
[38:13.460 --> 38:15.460]  They're going to get past him too
[38:15.460 --> 38:17.460]  I mean anyway, they're like that
[38:17.460 --> 38:19.460]  I'm not, but I thought
[38:19.460 --> 38:21.460]  He's bitten by the bug
[38:21.460 --> 38:23.460]  Went to see Metallica on the Death Magnetic tour
[38:23.460 --> 38:25.460]  And yeah, it's unfortunately
[38:25.460 --> 38:27.460]  It was a bit of a flashing pan
[38:27.460 --> 38:29.460]  Because it didn't really
[38:29.460 --> 38:31.460]  Didn't really stay far
[38:31.460 --> 38:33.460]  For that much longer because
[38:33.460 --> 38:35.460]  Yeah, but that time he's in came in high school
[38:35.460 --> 38:37.460]  And then my goodness, the stuff that he listens to
[38:37.460 --> 38:39.460]  It's a
[38:39.460 --> 38:41.460]  Music's also objective
[38:41.460 --> 38:43.460]  Isn't it, but I find it
[38:43.460 --> 38:45.460]  Quite challenging
[38:45.460 --> 38:47.460]  To listen to, but then you know
[38:47.460 --> 38:49.460]  Yeah, if I put some new young
[38:49.460 --> 38:51.460]  Like Bob Dylan on he can you see
[38:51.460 --> 38:53.460]  This game to me that
[38:53.460 --> 38:55.460]  It's that's a beauty of music
[38:55.460 --> 38:57.460]  What's the same one man's poisons
[38:57.460 --> 38:59.460]  There's other man's
[38:59.460 --> 39:01.460]  Something I don't know
[39:01.460 --> 39:03.460]  I think it's just typical
[39:03.460 --> 39:05.460]  It's a bit of baking
[39:05.460 --> 39:07.460]  The window isn't you probably just
[39:07.460 --> 39:09.460]  How that big truck flying past
[39:09.460 --> 39:11.460]  So yeah, Metallica they are and
[39:11.460 --> 39:13.460]  I'm seeing Metallica for a beginner
[39:13.460 --> 39:15.460]  I was actually that's not the name of the album
[39:15.460 --> 39:17.460]  The album, it's called, well it's a
[39:17.460 --> 39:19.460]  It's officially called Metallica
[39:19.460 --> 39:21.460]  But you know, it's
[39:21.460 --> 39:25.460]  The name is stock, it's called the Black album
[39:25.460 --> 39:27.460]  And it can in many ways
[39:27.460 --> 39:29.460]  It's like the Beatles white album
[39:29.460 --> 39:31.460]  Except the black, so the Beatles
[39:31.460 --> 39:33.460]  The white album was white
[39:33.460 --> 39:35.460]  And it had the Beatles logo
[39:35.460 --> 39:37.460]  Embossed on it
[39:37.460 --> 39:39.460]  And if you're lucky enough
[39:39.460 --> 39:41.460]  You've got one of the low numbers
[39:41.460 --> 39:43.460]  Because every copy was numbered
[39:43.460 --> 39:45.460]  But the Metallica
[39:45.460 --> 39:47.460]  Metallica album
[39:47.460 --> 39:49.460]  became known as the black album
[39:49.460 --> 39:51.460]  Because like the Beatles
[39:51.460 --> 39:53.460]  That album is black
[39:53.460 --> 39:55.460]  And the Metallica is just
[39:55.460 --> 39:57.460]  Very, very similar
[39:57.460 --> 39:59.460]  It's not embossed
[39:59.460 --> 40:01.460]  But it's a slightly kind of silvery
[40:01.460 --> 40:03.460]  Black Metallica is barely
[40:03.460 --> 40:05.460]  Legible really
[40:05.460 --> 40:07.460]  But like I see, it became
[40:07.460 --> 40:09.460]  I think certainly known by many
[40:09.460 --> 40:11.460]  As the black album
[40:11.460 --> 40:13.460]  Well, that was plenty
[40:13.460 --> 40:15.460]  I was kind of flown a bit of a curveball
[40:15.460 --> 40:17.460]  They are because a feather equals
[40:17.460 --> 40:19.460]  Come in and he's a
[40:19.460 --> 40:21.460]  He's coming next door
[40:21.460 --> 40:23.460]  Andrew Stoke and around here
[40:23.460 --> 40:25.460]  And my goodness, studio 2
[40:25.460 --> 40:27.460]  It was
[40:27.460 --> 40:29.460]  It was actually around so tonight
[40:29.460 --> 40:31.460]  Well, it's got the car
[40:31.460 --> 40:32.460]  And I thought the sun's out
[40:32.460 --> 40:33.460]  I'm going to
[40:33.460 --> 40:35.460]  As part of my training for
[40:35.460 --> 40:37.460]  For doing this charity raid for
[40:37.460 --> 40:39.460]  He's close to Fem
[40:39.460 --> 40:41.460]  I thought right, you know what?
[40:41.460 --> 40:43.460]  Absolutely no excuses
[40:43.460 --> 40:45.460]  I'm going to cycle
[40:45.460 --> 40:47.460]  And I'm actually pleased to see that
[40:47.460 --> 40:49.460]  That's a longer cycle
[40:49.460 --> 40:51.460]  I've done today
[40:51.460 --> 40:53.460]  It just came up with flagged up on my garment
[40:53.460 --> 40:55.460]  Here it says that it's 14 males
[40:55.460 --> 40:57.460]  I'm absolutely broken
[40:57.460 --> 40:59.460]  I'm just very much wet
[40:59.460 --> 41:01.460]  Behind the years when it comes to cycling
[41:01.460 --> 41:02.460]  Wasn't well planned out
[41:02.460 --> 41:03.460]  I mean really
[41:03.460 --> 41:05.460]  I'm a bit embarrassed
[41:05.460 --> 41:07.460]  If my wife's listening, she can happily tell me
[41:07.460 --> 41:09.460]  I told you so when I get home
[41:09.460 --> 41:11.460]  But it was probably a bit the last thing
[41:11.460 --> 41:13.460]  She said to me, if you got plenty of water
[41:13.460 --> 41:14.460]  I'm going to have a fine
[41:14.460 --> 41:16.460]  It's only 14 males
[41:16.460 --> 41:17.460]  I'll be fine
[41:17.460 --> 41:19.460]  Oh my goodness, it was like a puddle of water
[41:19.460 --> 41:20.460]  At the time I arrived here
[41:20.460 --> 41:21.460]  I'm absolutely broken
[41:21.460 --> 41:23.460]  There's no shops around here
[41:23.460 --> 41:25.460]  I'm completely patched
[41:25.460 --> 41:27.460]  But yeah
[41:27.460 --> 41:29.460]  Maybe it's just as well, she's not listening
[41:29.460 --> 41:30.460]  Could maybe do that
[41:30.460 --> 41:31.460]  I told you so
[41:31.460 --> 41:33.460]  Just to add salt to the wind
[41:33.460 --> 41:34.460]  As it were
[41:34.460 --> 41:35.460]  But yeah, it's so feathery
[41:35.460 --> 41:36.460]  It was coming in here
[41:36.460 --> 41:38.460]  So there was a lot maneuver
[41:38.460 --> 41:39.460]  And there was something
[41:39.460 --> 41:40.460]  It can move all that
[41:40.460 --> 41:41.460]  I'll shoot you two out
[41:41.460 --> 41:42.460]  The road
[41:42.460 --> 41:43.460]  Because it's so hot here
[41:43.460 --> 41:44.460]  I've got this
[41:44.460 --> 41:46.460]  The entrance is open there
[41:46.460 --> 41:47.460]  And I can add that
[41:47.460 --> 41:49.460]  Well I don't have to walk home
[41:49.460 --> 41:50.460]  Tonight
[41:50.460 --> 41:52.460]  You know in case somebody gets ideas about
[41:52.460 --> 41:54.460]  I was going to see bored on it
[41:54.460 --> 41:55.460]  Well I'll just call out
[41:55.460 --> 41:57.460]  I just got ideas about stealing it
[41:57.460 --> 41:58.460]  If the doors open
[41:58.460 --> 41:59.460]  I can't see
[41:59.460 --> 42:00.460]  So it's an interior one
[42:00.460 --> 42:02.460]  With me at the moment
[42:02.460 --> 42:03.460]  I'll top top
[42:03.460 --> 42:05.460]  I'm getting ready to go home
[42:05.460 --> 42:07.460]  But before that
[42:07.460 --> 42:09.460]  Before I'm talking about going home
[42:09.460 --> 42:10.460]  I'm still here for another
[42:10.460 --> 42:11.460]  Hour and a 15 minutes
[42:11.460 --> 42:13.460]  I've got a ton of time
[42:13.460 --> 42:15.460]  I'm saying I've got a ton of time
[42:15.460 --> 42:16.460]  I'll run out of time
[42:16.460 --> 42:18.460]  But I've got a lot of music
[42:18.460 --> 42:19.460]  There were things I'd go on at the moment
[42:19.460 --> 42:21.460]  I think I'll manage to
[42:21.460 --> 42:23.460]  To get it all in tonight
[42:23.460 --> 42:24.460]  I've got it going back to
[42:24.460 --> 42:28.460]  I did say when I played some black Sabbath there
[42:28.460 --> 42:30.460]  It wasn't the only event
[42:30.460 --> 42:32.460]  It was going on in Birmingham
[42:32.460 --> 42:34.460]  Sorry
[42:34.460 --> 42:35.460]  It wasn't the only event
[42:35.460 --> 42:37.460]  It was going on in Birmingham
[42:37.460 --> 42:38.460]  The weekend
[42:38.460 --> 42:40.460]  Although you would think it was
[42:40.460 --> 42:42.460]  But
[42:42.460 --> 42:44.460]  And we
[42:44.460 --> 42:46.460]  I think certainly my quarter
[42:46.460 --> 42:48.460]  Happily stand corrected
[42:48.460 --> 42:50.460]  But I think the black Sabbath event
[42:50.460 --> 42:52.460]  You can overshadow the fact that
[42:52.460 --> 42:54.460]  Yellow were playing in their hometown
[42:54.460 --> 42:57.460]  And on the Saturday and the Sunday
[42:57.460 --> 43:00.460]  And there
[43:00.460 --> 43:02.460]  Some point the speaker can't quite make a good bit tonight
[43:02.460 --> 43:03.460]  For all I know
[43:03.460 --> 43:05.460]  But I know they're playing Manchester
[43:05.460 --> 43:06.460]  A couple of dates in Manchester
[43:06.460 --> 43:08.460]  Before they head down to
[43:08.460 --> 43:09.460]  What will be
[43:09.460 --> 43:11.460]  And I've absolutely no doubt
[43:11.460 --> 43:12.460]  My mind after seeing them now
[43:12.460 --> 43:16.460]  Because he did look a little bit frail
[43:16.460 --> 43:17.460]  Excuse me
[43:17.460 --> 43:19.460]  Oh, how cut my feet
[43:19.460 --> 43:20.460]  But it's like a Sunday
[43:20.460 --> 43:21.460]  It was in a garage
[43:21.460 --> 43:23.460]  Just two days before he was
[43:23.460 --> 43:25.460]  Not seriously
[43:25.460 --> 43:27.460]  I'm glad to see
[43:27.460 --> 43:28.460]  Seriously
[43:28.460 --> 43:30.460]  And so much that you're still able to walk
[43:30.460 --> 43:32.460]  But he's got a broken hand
[43:32.460 --> 43:33.460]  For his troubles
[43:33.460 --> 43:35.460]  And he did see that he was in a lot of pain
[43:35.460 --> 43:37.460]  So yeah, when he was coming on
[43:37.460 --> 43:39.460]  He was very
[43:39.460 --> 43:41.460]  What's somewhat
[43:41.460 --> 43:43.460]  He was very
[43:43.460 --> 43:45.460]  He didn't quite hobble on
[43:45.460 --> 43:46.460]  But I tell you I'm absolutely
[43:46.460 --> 43:48.460]  Delighted to see
[43:48.460 --> 43:50.460]  It didn't impact his voice
[43:50.460 --> 43:51.460]  If anything
[43:51.460 --> 43:53.460]  If anything, he probably just looked a bit uncomfortable
[43:53.460 --> 43:55.460]  He stood behind a guitar
[43:55.460 --> 43:58.460]  Performing for the last 50 plus years
[43:58.460 --> 44:00.460]  And probably just didn't know what to do
[44:00.460 --> 44:01.460]  He's hands
[44:01.460 --> 44:02.460]  And you could see actually
[44:02.460 --> 44:05.460]  I mean, we had absolutely terrific seats
[44:05.460 --> 44:08.460]  My life managed to secure
[44:08.460 --> 44:09.460]  It was absolutely great
[44:09.460 --> 44:11.460]  So we could see absolutely everything
[44:11.460 --> 44:12.460]  But you could see right hand
[44:12.460 --> 44:14.460]  It was almost like
[44:15.460 --> 44:16.460]  It because it's his left hand
[44:16.460 --> 44:18.460]  It says broken the one that he'd hover on
[44:18.460 --> 44:19.460]  That on the fretboard
[44:19.460 --> 44:20.460]  But he's right hand
[44:20.460 --> 44:22.460]  He was kind of going as if he was strumming
[44:22.460 --> 44:24.460]  But he's left hand was kind of motionless
[44:24.460 --> 44:26.460]  Really
[44:26.460 --> 44:28.460]  I felt fell a bit sore
[44:28.460 --> 44:30.460]  But all that said
[44:30.460 --> 44:31.460]  What a show
[44:31.460 --> 44:32.460]  What a show
[44:32.460 --> 44:33.460]  I talked about it last night
[44:33.460 --> 44:34.460]  And I'm not going to go on
[44:34.460 --> 44:36.460]  I talked about it quite a bit
[44:36.460 --> 44:37.460]  I went last night
[44:37.460 --> 44:38.460]  On my show
[44:38.460 --> 44:39.460]  On a Tuesday evening
[44:39.460 --> 44:40.460]  Sunday sessions
[44:40.460 --> 44:41.460]  Which is
[44:41.460 --> 44:43.460]  Not the rock edition
[44:43.460 --> 44:45.460]  Like we're half here this evening
[44:45.460 --> 44:47.460]  It's the best way I can describe it
[44:47.460 --> 44:48.460]  I always bring on push to the corner
[44:48.460 --> 44:49.460]  I've read the requirements
[44:49.460 --> 44:50.460]  I'm going to be able to stay other week
[44:50.460 --> 44:52.460]  What sort of music do you play
[44:52.460 --> 44:53.460]  And I just think that sounds lame
[44:53.460 --> 44:55.460]  But it's the best way I can describe it
[44:55.460 --> 44:56.460]  A eclectic
[44:56.460 --> 44:58.460]  That's the best way I can see
[44:58.460 --> 44:59.460]  Best thing I can see
[44:59.460 --> 45:01.460]  So yeah
[45:01.460 --> 45:02.460]  We did play
[45:02.460 --> 45:03.460]  Quite a few tracks there
[45:06.460 --> 45:07.460]  Last night
[45:07.460 --> 45:10.460]  And so if you're available on a Tuesday evening
[45:10.460 --> 45:11.460]  From 8 to 10
[45:11.460 --> 45:12.460]  Please do come along
[45:12.460 --> 45:13.460]  Enjoy me
[45:13.460 --> 45:15.460]  Because you know we're starting to grow
[45:15.460 --> 45:16.460]  Quite a bit of community
[45:16.460 --> 45:18.460]  I mean I've never ever taken for granted
[45:18.460 --> 45:19.460]  Of course
[45:19.460 --> 45:21.460]  But we have a regular listeners
[45:21.460 --> 45:24.460]  And there's a wee bit of chat going back and forth
[45:24.460 --> 45:25.460]  And it's great
[45:25.460 --> 45:27.460]  It's great to kind of just get together
[45:27.460 --> 45:29.460]  With people that like-minded
[45:29.460 --> 45:32.460]  Drung individuals far for two hours or so

[52:30.520 --> 52:59.920]  You go, some engine, some engine, our short-sponsored Lenten butchers, like I see the sponsors
[52:59.920 --> 53:05.560]  of the Rockrim, or is I like to call it, right, a wrong I call it, there's on-down sessions
[53:05.560 --> 53:11.240]  the Rock edition. But yeah, right, on either side of that rock sandwich, if you
[53:11.240 --> 53:16.720]  well, we had the ELO. And crucially, that was ELO that we're listening to and do
[53:16.720 --> 53:21.480]  you. And it's increasingly because this got quite interesting back story, there's
[53:21.480 --> 53:28.480]  actually two versions of that by two bands written by the same person. So before ELO had made
[53:28.480 --> 53:35.160]  that famous in 1976, I think it was off the album, a new world record, I think I
[53:35.160 --> 53:42.920]  did not, because I'm kind of shooting from the hip here. The song was actually recorded
[53:42.920 --> 53:49.400]  by the move, which of course, Jeff Lennon was also a member of, and it was written by
[53:49.400 --> 53:55.000]  Jeff Lennon, and like I say, a flush recorded by the move, and appeared on the B-side of
[53:55.000 --> 54:00.400]  California, and very much became a bit of a cult favorite in the US, especially on the
[54:00.400 --> 54:05.640]  underground radio. But really, it was kind of, given a new lease of life, I mean, I
[54:05.640 --> 54:12.280]  think that version's, it's just the dynamics on it, or just a bit superior in my opinion.
[54:12.280 --> 54:17.440]  But when ELO started playing that song live, the audience responded so strongly that
[54:17.440 --> 54:23.440]  Jeff Lennon decided to rerecord it with ELO, and like I say, yeah, appeared on there.
[54:23.440 --> 54:28.080]  Actually, just while I was chatting there, I'm saying, shooting from the hip, yeah, it was
[54:28.080 --> 54:33.040]  on my, I'm hitting descocks here, and it did, I was, I was correct and saying, if you're
[54:33.040 --> 54:38.920]  on the 1976 album, I knew what old record, and I actually featured on their playlist
[54:38.920 --> 54:45.520]  there at the weekend, and it sounded, every bit, every bit is good live, as it did in the
[54:45.520 --> 54:47.920]  studio here tonight.
[54:53.440 --> 55:23.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah us yeah, that,
[56:23.440 --> 56:25.440]  Yay!
[57:23.440 --> 57:41.920]  From the Skyney Center at 7, the parents of survivors of the Southport Stabbings have
[57:41.920 --> 57:48.160]  revealed what they call the untold stories of their hero children, statements by the families
[57:48.160 --> 57:53.680]  of four girls injured when Axo Rudakabana, attacked a dance class, have been read to the
[57:53.680 --> 58:00.000]  public inquiry. They explain how their children now fear loud noises, or are always watching
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.800]  the door. The most painful of truth for us is that there were no adults to help. She was
[58:04.800 --> 58:09.840]  only spotted by other children. Where she was once eager to go off with her friends, she now
[58:09.840 --> 58:15.760]  needs my support if it's somewhere public or unknown. The inquiries looking into how authorities
[58:15.760 --> 58:21.200]  could have prevented last summer's attacks in which three girls were killed. A damning public
[58:21.200 --> 58:26.960]  inquiry reports warning victims of the infected blood scandal are being harmed further. It's
[58:26.960 --> 58:33.200]  chairs, a Brian Langstaffs criticised compensation delays, with survivors saying they're waiting
[58:33.200 --> 58:39.200]  to die in limbo. A 12-year-old boy's died following a flat fire in South East London,
[58:39.200 --> 58:43.680]  the blaze at the property in Lewis' room late last night, isn't believed to be suspicious.
[58:44.560 --> 58:49.440]  Resident doctors in England are going on strike for five days in a row later this month.
[58:49.440 --> 58:54.080]  The British Medical Association's announced they'll start on July 25th.
[58:54.080 --> 58:59.600]  Its members aren't happy at a proposed 5.4% pay rise. The health secretaries called the
[58:59.600 --> 59:06.720]  action unreasonable. Doctor Rosney Votes from the BMA. It's extremely disappointed we find ourselves
[59:06.720 --> 59:11.840]  in a situation today that does not have to be a single day of strike action.
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.200]  Our door remains open, where all we're treating these to do is sit down with us,
[59:15.200 --> 59:18.320]  and land a credible offer that will restore the doctor's fate.
[59:19.200 --> 59:23.040]  And England have thashed the Netherlands for nailing their second match at the women's
[59:23.040 --> 59:27.920]  heroes. Lauren James scored twice for the line S's, who responded empathetically to losing
[59:27.920 --> 59:33.440]  that opening game of the tournament, Wales take on France in tonight's other match in group D.
[59:33.440 --> 59:35.760]  That's the latest I'm Faye de Silver.

[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.760]  We are the best of the day of showtime.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:16.360]  of them and there's no studio trickery going on there. I remember seeing them actually
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:22.040]  a Marifio stadium long before it was flattened. Sorry, not Marifio. What am I talking about?
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:31.960]  What's the other one? What's flattened? The smaller one. Meadowbank. Meadowbank stadium.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:38.680]  Yeah, we flattened before it was and then rebuilt again. I feel like I think it was part of the
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:44.120]  French head there in the front. I think it was certainly round about that period. It was quite
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:50.520]  surprised that a band of that statue was playing in such a kind of small, I mean, I'm no idea where
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:57.480]  the capacity is but it's not, it's not really really that big. But that was a, that was a bit of a
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:04.360]  long day in my wife when I went and the doors opened at three. There was only one support band
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.520]  as we all can't believe it. It was my chemical romance and they're not really, they're not really
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:16.040]  maccopty, but we're down kind of, not quite there at the front but we're kind of near the front
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:21.480]  if you like. But when they came on, everybody was thrown beer and stuff like that and I don't know if
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:26.920]  it's an age thing or I'd like to think it's just a sensible thing. I thought, I'm not interested
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:32.360]  in in that. So we went, we went back up into the kind of seat in area and I just did
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:38.760]  there for the remainder of nine music came on and they were really, really good. And I think if
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:45.960]  me and it certainly correctly, I'm thinking, so that album, like olden revolutions came out in 2006
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.160]  and I think that is when I saw them, so they were probably touring that album. But I remember
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:57.240]  the play that track on and just like the last two minutes of that when it came to brakes,
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:04.280]  so it's just the Cribor gum. Absolutely bananas and I was able to enjoy that from a safe
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:11.560]  dry distance, because nobody was thrown beer when we retired up to that area. And yeah,
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:19.560]  before that we had just kind of scrolling back up here, what did we have? We had, I've, you know,
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:25.880]  was my thread. Where are we? I scrolled too far up, my goodness, before the news of, yes, we had,
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:35.000]  we had Jack White, old scratch blues and we had the followed that with a bit of a truncated version
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:43.320]  really, a song called Iron Horse by, by Candide. No, I'm just, with me cycling and I don't really
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:48.600]  have all my gadgets with me, so I've been a little bit slow and a bit undrespondent on the
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.800]  Facebook front so if, if I'm saying if you have, I, I know it's certainly no roof hard,
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.760]  because I've just picked up that message. If you are messaging me on the Sunday sessions,
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:06.760]  Facebook page, over at Sunday sessions UK, I will, we'll get to, I will get to the messages
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.640]  and certainly before for the show, but it's just, because I was cycling and I thought I'm
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:16.040]  going to travel like, so I don't really have all my gadgets here, so I've been a wee bit
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:23.720]  slow and picking these messages up, but it just shows you how slow. So Ruth is making reference
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:29.960]  to the Metallica track that I played in the first hour, perhaps even the first quarter of the show.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:37.880]  I'm certainly the first hour anyway, she's been in her head to that one. We've had a few
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:45.080]  head bangles since then, so you're delighted to know that you're going to be able to kind of ease
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.400]  up a little bit, because we're going to be slowing things down just a little slightly, not for
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:57.400]  the remainder of the show, but certainly for the next one or two songs. This is, um, um, this next track
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:05.480]  actually appeared on a, uh, a John Luch, John the Hukers album, the healer, and I bought this, um,
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:11.960]  on the strength of, of this single, and I, you know, hands up, I must confess. I was a little bit
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:18.920]  disappointed, really, that album is a whole, um, it's a, it was an album really here, um, the
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:25.720]  maybe one or two tracks that was just John Lee Huker on his own, but it was basically, um, a collaborative
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:32.920]  effort with, uh, I guess musicians that have been inspired or some way impacted or influenced
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:41.160]  by, um, by John Lee Huker. And once such artists was bunny-rate and, uh, this slide guitar and this is
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:48.440]  just absolutely gorgeous. It really, really is, um, so yeah, as much as the album for me was a bit
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:54.200]  of a disappointment. It was, uh, it was worth having it just to have this track. This is a song called
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.200]  I'm in the mood.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:22.200]  Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:35.480]  Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:39.480]  Amen, I'm in the mood.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:47.560]  I said, that time's right time, to be the one you love.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:58.840]  Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood. I'm in the mood.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:07.080]  Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:14.760]  Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.560]  What a rake!
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.560]  We guess my dad had told me...
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.560]  I knew it didn't leave that man alone.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.560]  Yes, it did.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.560]  But in my dad and tell me,
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.560]  I don't know.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.560]  Man was put now.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.560]  No, no, no, no.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560]  No, no.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.560]  You know what he did now?
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.560]  I'm gonna move over some of your love.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.560]  Baby.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:49.560]  I'm gonna move over some of your love.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:55.560]  I'm gonna move over some of your love.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.560]  Right, Charlie.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.560]  Baby.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.560]  Baby.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:09.560]  I'm gonna move over some of your love.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.560] itch up.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.560]  Let's go.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.560]  If I can't be between baby,
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.560]  I don't want me to know no one else.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.560]  I can't get my thrill, baby.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.560]  Let the beat of you, you, you, you.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.560]  Go night high, tired, right time.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.560]  I'll love the beat of the one you love, you love.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.560]  I'm in a movement, I'm a baby.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.560]  Oh, oh, I'm in a movement, love.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.560]  I'll never go near you.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.560]  I'll love the beat of me, oh, me.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.560]  I'll never go near you.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.560]  Oh, oh, I'm in a movement, love.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.560]  I'll never go near you, baby.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.560]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.560]  I'll never go near you.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.560]  I'll never go near you.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.560]  I'll love you, I'll love you, I'll love you.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:43.560]  I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.560]  I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.560]  I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:57.560]  I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:24.680]  I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, fingers
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.440]  Absolutely wonderful. I really really is and if you're listening to you're thinking, you
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:36.240]  know, that's insanely difficult to play, but I was going through a bit of a spell. You
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.520]  know, picking up the slide with us with the first time, it was not the first time I'd
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.360]  ever heard that, but what really, the sameity, can I get that whole glass slide, was
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:51.120]  it. I'd bought Texas's album Southside and there's a track on it called, I think it's called
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.920]  Southside, actually. I've got to not listen to it for a long time, but it's a short
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:00.000]  instrumental piece and I was like, wow, playing the slide, that must be really, really
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.320]  cool and I kind of nailed that and I thought, wow, this is easy and then I kind of just started
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.120]  double in a little bit and then I tried to play that thought, actually, it's not easy at all.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:18.880]  It's like, okay, I know, it's the guitar. It's a complicated piece, it does matter how long you're
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.840]  going to play. I think you're always, always, it's always going to be a little
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:26.760]  different. But really, he just can't beat your blues, can you?
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.720]  Girl, you know the reason why?
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.080]  Girl, you know the reason why?
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:35.080]  My mother was off the sky, my father was off the earth, my father was off the earth, my father
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.600]  You know when it's going to happen, right?
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:47.240]  Morning time.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.280]  Wantin' and I'm ready.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.040]  Girl, you know the reason why?
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:01.040]  The eagle picks my eyes
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.040]  The world will let my bone
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.040]  Be so soon inside
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.040]  Just like dinner, it's a girl
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.040]  No man
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.040]  From a dad
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.040]  If I didn't get away
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.040]  I didn't know the reason why
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.040]  That's why I brought from my room
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.040]  It's why my soul
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.040]  He's so soon inside
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.040]  Even him
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.040]  I brought the girl
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.040]  But dad
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.040]  Yes, but dad

[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.040]  So I did see you message her later on
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:52.040]  And I did pass it on to, to, to, to, to, to, to,
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.040]  To Andrew before it before you left
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.040]  But yeah, just echo your sentiment really
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.040]  Yeah, he did, he did really, really well
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.040]  Tonight, and I'm, I'm glad you actually sent him a DM on messenger to let him know
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.040]  Because I can tell you
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:10.040]  And I'm sure he wouldn't mind sharing with me
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.040]  Everybody's set off, make theories
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:17.040]  He's overwhelmed by, by the, kind of the important
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:22.040]  Of support that, that he's received by, by fellow presenters
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.040]  And listeners are like, and don't underestimate
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.040]  The, the impact that it's had on me
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:31.040]  He's, it really is touched by, um,
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:37.040]  Yeah, and, you know, like you, I, I couldn't have,
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.040]  I couldn't have done what he did
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.040]  Just tell you 10 days after
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:44.040]  After, and it should be proud
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.040]  And I've been telling that, I just, I just hope
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.040]  And these words are not falling, it's certainly about the proud
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.040]  They're not falling on deaf ears
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:57.040]  And he really, he, he really has kind of taken on board
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.040]  He did, he done himself proud
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.040]  And he done his mum proud, they're seeding and it really was
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.040]  I was, it was a wonderful show, really was
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.040]  Yeah, I saw, so could us, and, and thanks for, thanks for that message
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:13.040]  And like I see, he, he has actually, if now he's just, he's just
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.040]  And we're off to, to catch his bus now, just head in home
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:21.040]  But I, I did make a point, I point in that message out to him
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:24.040]  Before he left, I'm so, it's just a, myself and Federico
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:27.040]  That's in the building at the moment Federico
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.040]  Beras coming on and the next half hour for the Latin show
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.040]  And, uh, it's definitely worth it
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.040]  Sticking on for, on the other side of the show
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:39.040]  I mean, they're completely opposite ends of the spectrum
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.040]  If you like, for a music, but I was listening to him
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:46.040]  On my journey home, last week at the car
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:49.040]  And, uh, my goodness, he knows he's stuff about music
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:54.040]  That's for sure, I mean, it's been a bit of a, you know,
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.040]  Cause I like to dabble in the guitar
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.040]  I mean, it was actually really quite informative, you know, so
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:02.040]  Yeah, definitely stick around for our first show
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.040]  So, it's like I say, it's worth checking it
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:10.040]  And, but back to the show, um, we had, uh, we had a couple of tracks
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:15.040]  Yeah, I just, uh, I couldn't help myself really, I said, there's nothing wrong with your blues
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:19.040]  And, uh, that was our, I thought, I wrote a nice segue into a track called
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.040]  Your Blues, um, by the Beatles
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:27.040]  And we've already had a music from, uh, from Metallica on the black album
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.040]  So I thought, uh, it's only, by, by way of balance
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.040]  It would be only right that, uh, play something from the way to album
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.040]  And, uh, he can all well
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.040]  Anybody knows me knows that?
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:41.040]  Am I better, I'll be, it was not anyway, so, so I just thought, yeah,
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.040]  Can it indulge myself in that?
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.040]  And, uh, the version that we had there tonight, um,
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:51.040]  Like I said, it was from the way album, but that was the, the version, uh, had there
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:57.040]  The Joe's Martin, uh, treatment to it, if you like, what was already an absolute terrific album
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:01.040]  I mean, I know some people think, it's a bit of a kind of my, my album
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:05.040]  Um, revelers don't get me wrong, revolution number nine
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:11.040]  Number nine, uh, number nine is quite a challenging lesson
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:16.040]  Um, but, but really, it's, uh, it's got just like, we pocket a gold dust in there
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:21.040]  It really is, and like, as I, he said, oh, I think it, I think it's a great album
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.040]  I really, really do, so I get it, I like to say, here blues
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:30.040]  And, uh, what was already a great album, Joe's just, uh, just kind of sprinkle some,
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:34.040]  If he's magic dust on it and just gave what already was a great album
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:37.040]  I knew Lisa life, I mean, I'm just hearing things in it
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:41.040]  I've never heard before, and I hope you're hearing it at home in glorious
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:47.040]  Stereo because it's sounding absolutely terrific in the monitors here in this studio
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:52.040]  And, uh, we followed that with, uh, what was the opening track from the album
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:56.040]  The lens, uh, it was Queens of the Storage and feet don't feel me
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:00.040]  And it is quite a slow burn out there, but I just like the way it builds up
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.040]  And there's some sort of crescendo, it really is, you know, and, uh, we're roof
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:09.040]  Stereo's head banging, I can't help myself when it actually breaks into, like,
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:16.040]  What's about 90 seconds in that track, you know, it is kind of rollback and forward to that track
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.040]  It really, really does
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:52.040]  I've never been in baby in a Russian world
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.040]  A man, a man who doubts a name, Johnny, it'd be good
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:02.040]  A two-headed cow, and a fish that was, a famed by her lover
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:07.040]  And a monkey, the toss, a boy with wings, a nice, that's hot
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:13.040]  And a wreath of sports star, told us all about, but before it goes too
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:19.040]  Gorgeous, and I've had time before, but friends, I'm learning from the murder court
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:23.040]  A woman who died and came back from her home
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:27.040]  The person who slid and slid in bed
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:41.040]  They found the face, Jesus, all the nervous play
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:45.040]  And snowman fell on the sunshine state
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:49.040]  A man at the auto with his 20-third ride
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:53.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:57.040]  A billion dollar budget father stash a lift ass
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.040]  And a holy man told us not to answer
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:05.040]  And said, for it goes too Gorgeous, and I've had time before
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.040]  But friends, I'm learning from the murder court
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:13.040]  A woman who died and came back from her home
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:18.040]  The person who slid and slid in bed
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:34.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:51.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:53.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride

[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:09.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:14.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:17.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a raleway
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:18.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.040]  A million smile bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.040]  A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:58.040]  But we're in, I think that was Texas, I think we're in, I think we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in,
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:08.720]  we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we are, we're here, we're in, we're here, we're in, we're here, we're in, we're there, we're in, we're in, now, I'm just looking forward to Fight Up.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:53.040]  Take me back with a cold, not by myself, no more, I ain't asking for much.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.040]  I still don't take me down, take me down.
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.040]  I'm just looking for some touch.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:30.040]  Oh, two very short tracks. They're back to back.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:37.040]  Writh, I do wonder if you were a showtime Bengal when we played the first of those two there.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:41.040]  Because they had a lot of armor, kind of playing back country Bengal there tonight.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.040]  When I dropped the T's, I had an earlier one today about the show on the Sunday Insessions Facebook page.
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.040]  I did say that was going to be playing some back country.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:53.040]  And that was the picture and interesting, you were like, oh, I wonder where it could be.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:59.040]  You got a couple ideas, what could be? And a couple of suggestions actually.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:06.040]  So if that didn't take the box, please do send them away because we love here.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.040]  We love here. We love big cut. Well, I love here, actually. Really really enjoy myself.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:18.040]  That's why I don't do nights at the moment. But yeah, we love big country here at the Sunday Insessions.
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:25.040]  And the big country there, the big country there, I'm fucking to seek.
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:34.040]  That track, big country was lifted from the album, driving to Damascus, it was called the President slipped and fell.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:40.040]  And they just wrapped up a very, very successful tour of the U.S. air.
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:47.040]  I think it's a spanned many, many states around something 20, 25 gigs or so.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:53.040]  But quite interesting, I'm not a one for starting room or so, but I'll just put out the facts.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.040]  I'll let you maybe join the dots, perhaps incorrectly.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:01.040]  But like I say, I'm just replaying the facts.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:08.040]  So there was a number, if you follow big country and definitely worth following on the socials.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:16.040]  There are Bruce Watson, there were doing a pirore, there were some video blogs.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:20.040]  I think that's probably what they call them, but there were certainly doing some video shots.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:23.040]  And there was a few back to back.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:28.040]  I was rather curious, they were talking at length about White China.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:34.040]  No, I kind of wonder. You know, does that mean something?
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:40.040]  You know, they've got some dates lined up in the liquid rooms later this year.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.040]  The battle lines New Year's gig.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.040]  Who knows, what's the space?
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.040]  I certainly don't know anything, like I say.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.040]  I'm just giving you the facts.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.040]  Do what you want with them.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:55.040]  Trying to dots and perhaps like me, join them completely incorrectly.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:00.040]  But I thought, I thought it was, it definitely raised a bit of an eye, but I went ahead
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.040]  that it was talking about them.
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:07.040]  Not one, not on, minimally, too.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.040]  There may have been three, but it wasn't just the Audra Mark and talking on one video.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.040]  It was actually a couple, maybe even three, three videos that were talking.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:19.040]  I thought, hmm, that's interesting.
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:23.040]  Yeah, so anyway, like I say, I'm not wanting to start rumors.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:26.040]  So that was the big country, the president slept in Phil.
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.040]  And we followed that with a track called Tosh.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.040]  And that was by CZ Top.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.040]  So we're going to be slowing things down a little bit.
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:38.040]  And I know I already opened the show with some Steven Irvine.
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:43.040]  And I can make on my main, whether it was Steven Irvine and Double Trouble or Steven Irvine.
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:48.040]  But I can tell you, this is definitely just Steven Irvine.
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.040]  Just him and a 12 string guitar.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:06.040]  He looked at my old friend.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:11.040]  Not so long ago, it was really bad.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:16.040]  But bit outside of the phone range.
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:21.040]  I don't know where I'm for rowing, we started over here.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.040]  You live in a dream, though you won't stop.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:32.040]  But mind to think in a lot of old stuff.
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:41.040]  That's how it's happened, living like my other drop.
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:46.040]  Up and down and rolling and I won't ask you.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:51.040]  Talking about good times and singing the blues.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:56.040]  You and you and I stay behind.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:01.040]  We both knew it was best of matter of time.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:05.040]  Living a dream, though you won't stop.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:10.040]  But mind to think in a lot of old stuff.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:15.040]  That's how it happens, living like my other drop.
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:23.040]  Nobody's the time we're all the day.
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:29.040]  You're tuning up the bass and there's no easier way.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:33.040]  Time for my train of some man's doing it.
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.040]  Got his good to be walking together, my friend.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:43.040]  Living a dream, though you won't stop.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.040]  But mind to think in.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:56.040]  That's how it happens, living like my other drop.
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:05.040]  That's how it happens, living like my other drop.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:12.040]  That's how it happens, living like my other drop.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:16.040]  Life by the drop, by Steven Avon.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:20.040]  On our 12-inch 12-inch, 12-inch.
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:24.040]  Like in a 12-inch string.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.040]  I think the guitar was bigger than 12-inch is.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:30.040]  Yeah, as a 12-inch string that he was playing that.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.040]  It's actually credited to all that.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.040]  I'm not aware of it, but it says it.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:39.040]  That was an MTV performance on the sleeve notes.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.040]  Of that album that I was lifted from, like I see,
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:47.040]  I'm not aware of an MTV performance.
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:52.040]  I guess I could try a little bit harder and hit the old Google
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.040]  and have a little look.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.040]  Next up, I've played a band called Fanny before.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:04.040]  They've done an absolute terrific cover version of a Beatles track.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:09.040]  He's another terrific, they're all terrific.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.040]  Here's another great cover version.
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.040]  This is Batch.
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:44.040]  Think it about the times you drove in my car.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:52.040]  I think in that I might have drove it too far.
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:45:01.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:09.040]  I told you not to wander out in the dark.
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:17.040]  I told you not the swans that they live in the park.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.040]  Then I think about the kid.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:26.040]  Now she's ready to wave on.
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:34.040]  I told you not to wander out in the dark.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:38.040]  I told you not to wander out in the dark.
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:42.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:46.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:50.040]  I told you not to wander out in the dark.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:56.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:26.040]  I told you not to wander out in the dark.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:30.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:36.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:42.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:48.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:47:10.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:14.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:18.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:24.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:30.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:34.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:42.040]  Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:56.040]  There I think about the love that you let on my table.
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:02.040]  I think about the way I end up, early days but it's fun.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:08.440]  You know it's at the time I'm seeing at the time perhaps it still is I don't know what I mean I'm quite far removed from it
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:16.680]  But it certainly back then it was it was or is a meal dominated industry so so back then
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:19.400]  Back in 1970 that was a
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:25.960]  That was quite a big big thing but a bit fear-plated them and that's why I'm kind of back tracking a little bit in
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:29.880]  See anyway, it's just covers there are a lot more to covers because they they really have and it wasn't just a
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.880]  They weren't just a kind of
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:36.760]  I'm gonna say one hundred one dollar one album one that I feel like now the couple
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.440]  So I do encourage you to check them out if you enjoyed that
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:03.160]  Say

[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:58.060]  to you

[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:05.060]  When I listen
[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:10.060]  I can't listen
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:13.060]  The scratch on
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:17.060]  I don't know much
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:22.060]  I swear to such a bitch
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:24.060]  I can't listen
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:29.060]  I swear to such a bitch
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:54.060]  I don't know much
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:56.060]  I don't know much
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:50:59.060]  I swear to such a bitch
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:02.060]  I swear to such a bitch
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:09.060]  So
[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.060]  So
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:11.060]  So
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:14.060]  Can't you manage that
[01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:16.060]  Toilets
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:18.060]  To send a call
[01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:22.060]  When I listen
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:26.060]  When I listen
[01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:30.060]  I swear to such a bitch
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:34.060]  I swear to such a bitch
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:38.060]  I swear to such a bitch
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:44.060]  I swear to such a bitch
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:47.060]  I swear to such a bitch
[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:51.060]  I swear to such a dick

[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:12.060]  I swear…
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:32.060]  If you're right you, you can be fine too, you can be at the same time
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:43.060]  If you're right you, you can be fine too, you can be at the same time
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:53:05.060]  You were very hot and my own, my goodness, my wobbly tongue can't get my words out
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:10.060]  That was my iron lung by Radiohead
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:18.060]  I can't quite believe it really, I said earlier on, I thought I might have a gap if anybody wants to drop some
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:25.060]  Some requests and I'd happily take them if they kind of fit it in the show and my goodness
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:32.060]  There was a few tracks that didn't quite make the cut tonight, but we've got time to just shoot on one more
[01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:40.060]  And before I go, like I say, feather equals just kind of set it up, it's just kind of chopping it
[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:45.060]  It's not chopping at the door, is that the door we're going to be doing a hand over real soon
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:50.060]  But I do encourage you to kind of stick around and listen to your show, it's very, very good
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:55.060]  And if you enjoyed tonight, hopefully you did, I've had a bold tonight
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:59.060]  I mean the sun is out, I can't see I'm looking for the cycline home tonight
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:02.060]  But there you go
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:08.060]  Yeah, so please do join me next week in the end of the rock room from 6 to late
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:14.060]  Or if you can't wait till Wednesday, join me on Tuesday from 8 to 10
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:17.060]  We'll play some eclectic music
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:23.060]  But until then, whatever you're doing, enjoy the sunshine because it's absolutely, absolutely marvelous day
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:29.060]  This evening and hopefully hopefully I'll speak to you, see you again
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:32.060]  I need to work out how to wrap up a show
[01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:35.060]  I'm really, really do, I'm just mumbling here
[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:40.060]  I'm going to play out with a gate pop, this is the passenger
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:55:13.060]  I am a passenger and ride a ride a ride through a city of exercise
[01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:16.060]  I see the stars come out at this car
[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:20.060]  And share the ride on a hollow sky
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:23.060]  You know it looks so good tonight
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:34.060]  I am the passenger
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:37.060]  I stay on your glass
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:41.060]  I look blue my windows are bright
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:45.060]  I see the stars come out tonight
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.060]  And if the ride on a hollow sky
