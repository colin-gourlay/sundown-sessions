It's Wednesday evening, here at East Coast FM, and that can mean only one thing for the next two hours.
Anyway, we'll be playing some of the finest rock tunes, rock tunes, rock music.
It's certainly a great mat on tables for the last few years.
But before a bit of a serious point, really, before I get into all the music, I need to thank Andrew really for,
well, there's a number of reasons why I really need to thank him.
First of all, thank him for, you know, this afternoon, he's a great time shopping,
but thank you as well for actually sharing these memories.
These personal memories, just grown up as a child, you know, he's hacking back to me,
you know, when his mum's in muscle bar before moving to long-nidry, and what I have here,
it was really touched.
And for those that don't know, Andrew's mum passed away just ten days ago,
and this was, he was wanting to come back to the, to do a really special show for the day,
because we'd have been sadly, we'd have been our birthday today, so I think,
thank you for, like I say, so many reasons, I mean, it was very brave.
I was listening to the opening of the show, and I just astonished that he managed to keep it together.
He'd done an absolutely wonderful job, and in fact, just during the handover there,
he did say that, you know, he hoped he'd done his mum proud,
and then finishing up there with the illnesses, the wonder of you, and you know,
goodness, I feel like I need some tissues here, you know, it's hard not to be affected,
but I've absolutely no doubt, my mind that he did do his mum absolutely proud,
and he should be proud of himself actually for coming into the day, and actually doing that,
that took quite a bit of courage to do, and, like I say, thank you again for, for sharing those stories.
With, with not just these close to FM family, but just the wider community, everybody out there listening,
because I do know as well, like I say, I mean, I was working this afternoon,
and I caught, for the most part, the majority of the show, but I'm sure it got a lot of comfort
from all the text messages that were coming into the studio, and it just really shows how
they thought Andrew is, and, yeah, it's nice, it kind of validate, he has well thought of,
but it's nice with all these messages coming in, it kind of somewhat validates that.
Right, yeah, so business is usual, back to the sundown sessions, the rock edition, if you will,
like I say, for the next two hours, we're going to be playing some absolute brilliant,
let's go see, rock tunes, yeah, things that fall under the rock genre,
and the rock genre has so many sub-genres, basically means I can go cut blinds,
I can basically play literally everything and get away with it and see it's rock,
and what better we need to start off with this.

on the album that proceeded that Texas floods released back in 1984.
No, well, that was playing there.
We've actually had a couple of texts coming in and actually, you know, I'll read them out
because Andrew's still here, he's a next door, he's keeping an eye on my bike, I say
go don't do this to you. I'm just kind of thinking he's maybe listening to the show as
well, or maybe he's preparing for the next-again show, but uh, so at the first one, like I
say, we'll just walk through them, so we're ready. Good evening, Colin. How are you doing? I'm doing
really well, Ray. Thanks so much for joining me. You're in for a real treat tonight,
got some terrific music. Um, well, I guess I say that everything don't know. And uh, that was
followed by Mark, uh, no apologies, Mark, uh, I'm not quite got your second name, it's uh, Mark Mc
something. I don't know, it's uh, the, uh, your name's been truncated, unfortunately, but uh, but
you see, well done Andrew, we are all thinking of you. And there, uh, and uh, Lorraine, uh,
our very own Lorraine has said evening, Colin, Andrew, yeah, absolutely. Um, evening, Colin,
Andrew is so brave. I'm in Brits after it and Lubby, uh, of course, Lubby's his mom,
Lubby would be proud of him. And I've absolutely no doubt about that. Um, it was, uh, it was
so brave, you know, I've just uh, couldn't agree more, Lorraine. Uh, me, he done, done an absolutely
amazing job. And I hope in some ways it was, uh, somewhat cathartic for him, because I,
I imagine he's, I'm seeing he's sitting next door. I can't quite see there's, there's so many
more of a thousand years, but, um, you know, I imagine he's probably kind of decompressing
if you are, because, uh, you know, he's kind of real living a lot of his own past. There's
bellies, he's mums and recouping, uh, all the happy days, uh, of his childhood and, and what
I have here when he's talking about his grandparents and everything. So, uh, yeah, good on
our laundry is good on our laundry, good on our laundry, doesn't really really well. And, uh,
like I say, it's nice that all these messages coming in, I'm sure he's, he's listening
next door and he can hear them. And if he's not, uh, when the next track is playing, I'll make
a point of grabbing him. Pull him through the monitor so you can see that we are all very, very
much behind him. Um, so yeah, back to the music, I was, I kind of want to correct myself here
when I'm saying it as a common part three of us are steving, uh, at Jimmy Hendrix cover. That's
not actually quite correct. Um, it's said the, the blues button, if you like, was very much
passed down, um, from one musician to another, it was originally, uh, originally, uh, it was a
track, uh, by Earl King, it was called Come On, let the good times roll. And, uh, Jimmy,
Jimmy Hendrix, um, I think it was on Axis Bolder's Love, um, he's, uh, second album, the
Jimmy Hendrix experience, um, it was called Come On Part One. And stevary divorce, stevary
version that we heard there, like I say, that was Come On Part Three. So, a lot of it wasn't the
same title, um, and it's not a direct cover, or if you like it, certainly, I would say it's a continuation,
and it's a certainly, in order to, to Jimmy Hendrix. And if you've ever seen, I've talked about it
this before, and a previous show, uh, if you've not seen it, because you need to check it out, because
it's just, it's just, it's just, it's in what that man can do with the guitar, um, um, yeah, if you,
if you look for, I'm sure it'll be on YouTube now. It's so sold. I mean, I've got it on DVD, um, stevary
divorce, and double travel live at the El McCambo. And, uh, it must have been a period when
it was promote now, bomb Texas flood, uh, but like I say, back in 1984, because, uh, the, the tracks from
that album feature quite heavily, not exclusively, um, big, quite heavily. And there's an absolutely
beautiful, uh, it's what's just watching it for this, uh, beautiful track called Lenny, uh, which was, uh,
was a, it's an instrumental track, um, but it, it wrote that, uh, dedicated to his wife.
Yeah, so, uh, anyway, without much further ado, I'm just, uh, Andrew's kind of, uh, I don't know
if he's waving at me or something like that. I'll just think the next track on, we'll see if,
see what he's after, I mean, he's, like, he's looking from a bit of, a bit of my attention.
Yeah.
Look at all the good times, won't see the time,
because I'm the man, show you around.
It's not in talks, I want to hear it sing.
If you've got the redness, then I'll sing,
song is a crisis, like, as long as the virus is right,
it got no bad choice, you'd ask, then, uh,
back from the car game, the ace in the hole, the speaker on the right hand,
and then my soul's, I've seen the movie and I've ran the book,
I don't need no second rule, it's almost a crisis, right? It's almost a crisis, right?
It's almost a crisis, like, as long as the virus is right,
you'd ask, then, uh, you'd ask, then, uh, you'd just ask, you'd ask,
then, uh, you'd ask, then, uh, you'd just ask, you'd ask,
you'd ask, then, uh, okay, let's sort this out,
As long as the five sits right
As long as the five sits right
As long as the five sits right
You've got more cash
You've got enough cash
You've got no cash
You've got enough cash
You've got enough cash
You've got enough cash
You've got enough cash
You've got enough cash
You've got enough cash
You've got enough cash
As long as the price is right
Just about that was planned
They were so underypopt
You've just been away
Because it was quite keen to see the extent
There were coming in
But it was just an exaggerating attention
Too much a lot more to a pop-in
So here it's a decent next story
He's listening to the show
And he's just doing some bits and pieces
So he's going to be sticking around
So, you know if you want to send the message then feel free to do so you can text a studio on
Where does it or there is right do you know I don't know how many times I've read this number
I've just not committed it to memory. Okay, so I just just need my wee kind of flyer here
So you can text a studio on 0 7 8 35 90 20 30 and
Yeah, get messages if you want to hear your name and then you do I'm more than happy to
Can you read that out and you know, well quite a jump act
Playless this evening, but if there's something that you're absolutely anchoring to hear
And who knows who knows we might just have a wee space slot that I could maybe
shoehorn something and but like like I say we'll just kind of
Kind of suck and see if here we go on again this is what it's already 20 past six
Should should be plain add about friend about now, but uh
But I had planned to play this I heard the ad about so just uh on the other side of this I was coupon track
Uh, well we've had the ad about
I
Love the dead before they're cool
The blue and flesh or meat or
Cadever eyes upon me see
Nothing

We've just just before the adverts there, we had some Alice Cooper, and I'll tell you
to myself, I opted for that track, I treated myself fairly recently, to a copy of a billion
dollar babies.
It's been a huge record company, it's been a no-how to get the money out of my pockets.
I mean, I don't know how many copies of that album, billion dollar babies are already, but
kind of remastered, repackaged, and I was out in 180 grand, but I mean, it is a thing
of beauty, it's just much like the original, and it's a beautiful album, it's like Crocodile
skin, I feel like, although it's a bit so you can describe it, but it's really really nice
and it's a great album, and yeah, so then that was followed by adverts and then on the other
side of that, unless, so if you're tuned into the show this evening, rock is obviously
your jam, so I don't need to tell you unless you've been living on the moon, or some
other exotic place, there was a big, big event, then I'm burning up at the weekend there, of
course talking about the last ever Black Sabbath performance, we were at Aussie Tuk-to-Stage
Alarmouth, Tony Omey, and crew, but it was a bit more than just Black Sabbath, I've looked
at the rundown of the entire day, so there was like a lot of bands who have been, I
was quite affected, influenced rather, influenced by Sabbath, they were invited to perform
and there was goodness, so at the top of my head, it's like a who's who of em, if it
air guitars, you're a thing, it's a who's who, notably for me, no no bit in court, had
tonned up, he was playing out in it all star band, and if you're tuned in a few weeks
ago, you will obviously recall that I did actually chat about the time that I met him
and we went backstage and yeah, my son, we got the autographs, autographs, set list, some
photos, and he was a lovely, lovely guy, and without the whole story, he was just really
really keen on how we got the backstage things, and actually it happened to catch my son
who was very young at the time, I think he was maybe in the first seven, first year, you
know he's sent the pre-teen years anyway, but it was a bit concerned about I'm getting
crushed and he clocked him in the crowding, A and Vita Tamovar, and yes, almost on the
year, you got to set up on the side of the stage, for the remainder of the gig, and just
so that I could meet up with him, I got backstage passes, and we met up in he was, it wasn't
just about to save me, but why was that I guess, he was so generous this time, he was just
kind of really thrilled that it's like the next-again generation, if you like, of fans,
that are coming along, it's not just like him, olden, bold people like myself that are
going along, it's like a new fans, if you like, and it was equally thrilled to learn
that Liam at the time anyway, he was learning to play the guitar, and he's just given him
all the encouragement you could ever ask for, I love the lovely guy, and yes, he was playing
the early old star band, goodness of gone, gone a little bit blank, guns and roses, I'm not
quite sure if it was the entire original line, I'm certainly actual rose was performing slash
was there, but I don't know, but is it Stradlin and what have you, but like for me, a real
notable appearance slash performance was a Metallica, they played, they played, I need to,
actually, I was not the gig, I was down in the environment, you can, they'll come to that shortly,
but just kind of after the fact that I was chatting to somebody in a bar and he was, he was talking
about Metallica and they said, the play battery, which is a really really early, it's a very,
it's almost like thrashing, it was not really thrashing metal, but I'm just, because I can't
think of another, another tie-top, I'm just going to say it's a bit more of a kind of thrashing metal
rather than the kind of later stuff, and there were the few other tracks on that, I had a 30 minute
set, as did, because there were so, so many bands, a lot of them, there was a lot of bands at a
period, but they all had a quite short set, but they wrapped up with a cover version of a black
Sabbath song, but tonight I'm going to play a track from really, I don't know if it might go to
album, I certainly play it a lot, it's from what became known as the black album, this is a second track
on that album, this is called Sad Butte True.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know it's bad for sure.
Stat put true.
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you
I'm your fan, I'm your fan
You know it's a good show
I'm making out
Hey, hey, hey
I'm your hate, I'm your hate when you want love
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm your life, I know one who took you there
Hey, hey, hey
I'm your life, and I no longer care
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your life when you must steal
I'm your fan, when you can't feel
That put you, I'm your truth
Telling why it's, I'm your reason, I live by it
I'm inside open your eyes
I'm your, oh
That's what true
Yo, I was actually playing the air drums here
I was a thing until until I was just sitting here listening to it
I'm absolutely terrific track and really if there was
If there was ever an album that needed to be kind of
Framed as Metallica for beginners
That is definitely there
They go to album for me anyway
And that's the album
You really need to check out fast
Because that means they've got
A score, I'm scoring albums
I've got a lot of great tracks
Great tracks, great albums
But like for me that is like
Consistent through
Really inter-sad man
Nothing else matters
That takes on a bit of a special menu
And really because
My son that was the first song he learned
to play in the guitar actually
And that was me and I thought that set
I've cracked that not
He's going to
He's going to get these guitars that I have
They're all going to get people
They're going to get past him too
I mean anyway, they're like that
I'm not, but I thought
He's bitten by the bug
Went to see Metallica on the Death Magnetic tour
And yeah, it's unfortunately
It was a bit of a flashing pan
Because it didn't really
Didn't really stay far
For that much longer because
Yeah, but that time he's in came in high school
And then my goodness, the stuff that he listens to
It's a
Music's also objective
Isn't it, but I find it
Quite challenging
To listen to, but then you know
Yeah, if I put some new young
Like Bob Dylan on he can you see
This game to me that
It's that's a beauty of music
What's the same one man's poisons
There's other man's
Something I don't know
I think it's just typical
It's a bit of baking
The window isn't you probably just
How that big truck flying past
So yeah, Metallica they are and
I'm seeing Metallica for a beginner
I was actually that's not the name of the album
The album, it's called, well it's a
It's officially called Metallica
But you know, it's
The name is stock, it's called the Black album
And it can in many ways
It's like the Beatles white album
Except the black, so the Beatles
The white album was white
And it had the Beatles logo
Embossed on it
And if you're lucky enough
You've got one of the low numbers
Because every copy was numbered
But the Metallica
Metallica album
became known as the black album
Because like the Beatles
That album is black
And the Metallica is just
Very, very similar
It's not embossed
But it's a slightly kind of silvery
Black Metallica is barely
Legible really
But like I see, it became
I think certainly known by many
As the black album
Well, that was plenty
I was kind of flown a bit of a curveball
They are because a feather equals
Come in and he's a
He's coming next door
Andrew Stoke and around here
And my goodness, studio 2
It was
It was actually around so tonight
Well, it's got the car
And I thought the sun's out
I'm going to
As part of my training for
For doing this charity raid for
He's close to Fem
I thought right, you know what?
Absolutely no excuses
I'm going to cycle
And I'm actually pleased to see that
That's a longer cycle
I've done today
It just came up with flagged up on my garment
Here it says that it's 14 males
I'm absolutely broken
I'm just very much wet
Behind the years when it comes to cycling
Wasn't well planned out
I mean really
I'm a bit embarrassed
If my wife's listening, she can happily tell me
I told you so when I get home
But it was probably a bit the last thing
She said to me, if you got plenty of water
I'm going to have a fine
It's only 14 males
I'll be fine
Oh my goodness, it was like a puddle of water
At the time I arrived here
I'm absolutely broken
There's no shops around here
I'm completely patched
But yeah
Maybe it's just as well, she's not listening
Could maybe do that
I told you so
Just to add salt to the wind
As it were
But yeah, it's so feathery
It was coming in here
So there was a lot maneuver
And there was something
It can move all that
I'll shoot you two out
The road
Because it's so hot here
I've got this
The entrance is open there
And I can add that
Well I don't have to walk home
Tonight
You know in case somebody gets ideas about
I was going to see bored on it
Well I'll just call out
I just got ideas about stealing it
If the doors open
I can't see
So it's an interior one
With me at the moment
I'll top top
I'm getting ready to go home
But before that
Before I'm talking about going home
I'm still here for another
Hour and a 15 minutes
I've got a ton of time
I'm saying I've got a ton of time
I'll run out of time
But I've got a lot of music
There were things I'd go on at the moment
I think I'll manage to
To get it all in tonight
I've got it going back to
I did say when I played some black Sabbath there
It wasn't the only event
It was going on in Birmingham
Sorry
It wasn't the only event
It was going on in Birmingham
The weekend
Although you would think it was
But
And we
I think certainly my quarter
Happily stand corrected
But I think the black Sabbath event
You can overshadow the fact that
Yellow were playing in their hometown
And on the Saturday and the Sunday
And there
Some point the speaker can't quite make a good bit tonight
For all I know
But I know they're playing Manchester
A couple of dates in Manchester
Before they head down to
What will be
And I've absolutely no doubt
My mind after seeing them now
Because he did look a little bit frail
Excuse me
Oh, how cut my feet
But it's like a Sunday
It was in a garage
Just two days before he was
Not seriously
I'm glad to see
Seriously
And so much that you're still able to walk
But he's got a broken hand
For his troubles
And he did see that he was in a lot of pain
So yeah, when he was coming on
He was very
What's somewhat
He was very
He didn't quite hobble on
But I tell you I'm absolutely
Delighted to see
It didn't impact his voice
If anything
If anything, he probably just looked a bit uncomfortable
He stood behind a guitar
Performing for the last 50 plus years
And probably just didn't know what to do
He's hands
And you could see actually
I mean, we had absolutely terrific seats
My life managed to secure
It was absolutely great
So we could see absolutely everything
But you could see right hand
It was almost like
It because it's his left hand
It says broken the one that he'd hover on
That on the fretboard
But he's right hand
He was kind of going as if he was strumming
But he's left hand was kind of motionless
Really
I felt fell a bit sore
But all that said
What a show
What a show
I talked about it last night
And I'm not going to go on
I talked about it quite a bit
I went last night
On my show
On a Tuesday evening
Sunday sessions
Which is
Not the rock edition
Like we're half here this evening
It's the best way I can describe it
I always bring on push to the corner
I've read the requirements
I'm going to be able to stay other week
What sort of music do you play
And I just think that sounds lame
But it's the best way I can describe it
A eclectic
That's the best way I can see
Best thing I can see
So yeah
We did play
Quite a few tracks there
Last night
And so if you're available on a Tuesday evening
From 8 to 10
Please do come along
Enjoy me
Because you know we're starting to grow
Quite a bit of community
I mean I've never ever taken for granted
Of course
But we have a regular listeners
And there's a wee bit of chat going back and forth
And it's great
It's great to kind of just get together
With people that like-minded
Drung individuals far for two hours or so
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Like a such a rage, so tell me everything, I'm not trying to tell you, I'm behind you, but it's the same thing that I need to know.
You're gonna find out, you're gonna find out, you're gonna find out, you're gonna find out.
You're gonna find out, you're gonna find out, you're gonna find out.
Everyone happening to come to learn all's the blame, yes it's the blame.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You go, some engine, some engine, our short-sponsored Lenten butchers, like I see the sponsors
of the Rockrim, or is I like to call it, right, a wrong I call it, there's on-down sessions
the Rock edition. But yeah, right, on either side of that rock sandwich, if you
well, we had the ELO. And crucially, that was ELO that we're listening to and do
you. And it's increasingly because this got quite interesting back story, there's
actually two versions of that by two bands written by the same person. So before ELO had made
that famous in 1976, I think it was off the album, a new world record, I think I
did not, because I'm kind of shooting from the hip here. The song was actually recorded
by the move, which of course, Jeff Lennon was also a member of, and it was written by
Jeff Lennon, and like I say, a flush recorded by the move, and appeared on the B-side of
California, and very much became a bit of a cult favorite in the US, especially on the
underground radio. But really, it was kind of, given a new lease of life, I mean, I
think that version's, it's just the dynamics on it, or just a bit superior in my opinion.
But when ELO started playing that song live, the audience responded so strongly that
Jeff Lennon decided to rerecord it with ELO, and like I say, yeah, appeared on there.
Actually, just while I was chatting there, I'm saying, shooting from the hip, yeah, it was
on my, I'm hitting descocks here, and it did, I was, I was correct and saying, if you're
on the 1976 album, I knew what old record, and I actually featured on their playlist
there at the weekend, and it sounded, every bit, every bit is good live, as it did in the
studio here tonight.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

From the Skyney Center at 7, the parents of survivors of the Southport Stabbings have
revealed what they call the untold stories of their hero children, statements by the families
of four girls injured when Axo Rudakabana, attacked a dance class, have been read to the
public inquiry. They explain how their children now fear loud noises, or are always watching
the door. The most painful of truth for us is that there were no adults to help. She was
only spotted by other children. Where she was once eager to go off with her friends, she now
needs my support if it's somewhere public or unknown. The inquiries looking into how authorities
could have prevented last summer's attacks in which three girls were killed. A damning public
inquiry reports warning victims of the infected blood scandal are being harmed further. It's
chairs, a Brian Langstaffs criticised compensation delays, with survivors saying they're waiting
to die in limbo. A 12-year-old boy's died following a flat fire in South East London,
the blaze at the property in Lewis' room late last night, isn't believed to be suspicious.
Resident doctors in England are going on strike for five days in a row later this month.
The British Medical Association's announced they'll start on July 25th.
Its members aren't happy at a proposed 5.4% pay rise. The health secretaries called the
action unreasonable. Doctor Rosney Votes from the BMA. It's extremely disappointed we find ourselves
in a situation today that does not have to be a single day of strike action.
Our door remains open, where all we're treating these to do is sit down with us,
and land a credible offer that will restore the doctor's fate.
And England have thashed the Netherlands for nailing their second match at the women's
heroes. Lauren James scored twice for the line S's, who responded empathetically to losing
that opening game of the tournament, Wales take on France in tonight's other match in group D.
That's the latest I'm Faye de Silver.

of them and there's no studio trickery going on there. I remember seeing them actually
a Marifio stadium long before it was flattened. Sorry, not Marifio. What am I talking about?
What's the other one? What's flattened? The smaller one. Meadowbank. Meadowbank stadium.
Yeah, we flattened before it was and then rebuilt again. I feel like I think it was part of the
French head there in the front. I think it was certainly round about that period. It was quite
surprised that a band of that statue was playing in such a kind of small, I mean, I'm no idea where
the capacity is but it's not, it's not really really that big. But that was a, that was a bit of a
long day in my wife when I went and the doors opened at three. There was only one support band
as we all can't believe it. It was my chemical romance and they're not really, they're not really
maccopty, but we're down kind of, not quite there at the front but we're kind of near the front
if you like. But when they came on, everybody was thrown beer and stuff like that and I don't know if
it's an age thing or I'd like to think it's just a sensible thing. I thought, I'm not interested
in in that. So we went, we went back up into the kind of seat in area and I just did
there for the remainder of nine music came on and they were really, really good. And I think if
me and it certainly correctly, I'm thinking, so that album, like olden revolutions came out in 2006
and I think that is when I saw them, so they were probably touring that album. But I remember
the play that track on and just like the last two minutes of that when it came to brakes,
so it's just the Cribor gum. Absolutely bananas and I was able to enjoy that from a safe
dry distance, because nobody was thrown beer when we retired up to that area. And yeah,
before that we had just kind of scrolling back up here, what did we have? We had, I've, you know,
was my thread. Where are we? I scrolled too far up, my goodness, before the news of, yes, we had,
we had Jack White, old scratch blues and we had the followed that with a bit of a truncated version
really, a song called Iron Horse by, by Candide. No, I'm just, with me cycling and I don't really
have all my gadgets with me, so I've been a little bit slow and a bit undrespondent on the
Facebook front so if, if I'm saying if you have, I, I know it's certainly no roof hard,
because I've just picked up that message. If you are messaging me on the Sunday sessions,
Facebook page, over at Sunday sessions UK, I will, we'll get to, I will get to the messages
and certainly before for the show, but it's just, because I was cycling and I thought I'm
going to travel like, so I don't really have all my gadgets here, so I've been a wee bit
slow and picking these messages up, but it just shows you how slow. So Ruth is making reference
to the Metallica track that I played in the first hour, perhaps even the first quarter of the show.
I'm certainly the first hour anyway, she's been in her head to that one. We've had a few
head bangles since then, so you're delighted to know that you're going to be able to kind of ease
up a little bit, because we're going to be slowing things down just a little slightly, not for
the remainder of the show, but certainly for the next one or two songs. This is, um, um, this next track
actually appeared on a, uh, a John Luch, John the Hukers album, the healer, and I bought this, um,
on the strength of, of this single, and I, you know, hands up, I must confess. I was a little bit
disappointed, really, that album is a whole, um, it's a, it was an album really here, um, the
maybe one or two tracks that was just John Lee Huker on his own, but it was basically, um, a collaborative
effort with, uh, I guess musicians that have been inspired or some way impacted or influenced
by, um, by John Lee Huker. And once such artists was bunny-rate and, uh, this slide guitar and this is
just absolutely gorgeous. It really, really is, um, so yeah, as much as the album for me was a bit
of a disappointment. It was, uh, it was worth having it just to have this track. This is a song called
I'm in the mood.
Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood.
Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood.
Amen, I'm in the mood.
I said, that time's right time, to be the one you love.
Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood. I'm in the mood.
Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen.
Amen, I'm in the mood. Amen, I'm in the mood.
What a rake!
We guess my dad had told me...
I knew it didn't leave that man alone.
Yes, it did.
But in my dad and tell me,
I don't know.
Man was put now.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
You know what he did now?
I'm gonna move over some of your love.
Baby.
I'm gonna move over some of your love.
I'm gonna move over some of your love.
Right, Charlie.
Baby.

I'm gonna move over some of your love.

Let's go.
If I can't be between baby,
I don't want me to know no one else.
I can't get my thrill, baby.
Let the beat of you, you, you, you.
Go night high, tired, right time.
I'll love the beat of the one you love, you love.
I'm in a movement, I'm a baby.
Oh, oh, I'm in a movement, love.
I'll never go near you.
I'll love the beat of me, oh, me.
I'll never go near you.

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, fingers
Absolutely wonderful. I really really is and if you're listening to you're thinking, you
know, that's insanely difficult to play, but I was going through a bit of a spell. You
know, picking up the slide with us with the first time, it was not the first time I'd
ever heard that, but what really, the sameity, can I get that whole glass slide, was
it. I'd bought Texas's album Southside and there's a track on it called, I think it's called
Southside, actually. I've got to not listen to it for a long time, but it's a short
instrumental piece and I was like, wow, playing the slide, that must be really, really
cool and I kind of nailed that and I thought, wow, this is easy and then I kind of just started
double in a little bit and then I tried to play that thought, actually, it's not easy at all.
It's like, okay, I know, it's the guitar. It's a complicated piece, it does matter how long you're
going to play. I think you're always, always, it's always going to be a little
different. But really, he just can't beat your blues, can you?
Girl, you know the reason why?
Girl, you know the reason why?
My mother was off the sky, my father was off the earth, my father was off the earth, my father
You know when it's going to happen, right?
Morning time.

Pink don't smell it now
Let's just go for it
Life is hard, that's why there was a virus
Not much older than I thought I'd be
Feel like a fool, it's like a dance fool
Foot, foot, sound, bounce, and free
Oh, deep, don't smell it now
Saved in the gun, my dance to the clouds
Pink don't smell it now
Let's just go for it
Be there, have to dot ther
Girl, let's decide off
Breaking bust and sorrow
Don't know except for me
One, two, one

Me and my gang come to bust you loose
We move with the emergency between pleasure and me
All alone, that's the sour ones call me
It's calling me, it's calling me
It's calling me, it's calling me
It's calling me, it's calling me
It's calling me, it's calling me
It's calling me, it's calling me
Time to go, we're praying
They are, we're going to get us to go
There's a chance, but it's a matter of opinion
We're taking our hands
All alone, that's the sour ones call me
They are, we're praying
All alone, that's the sour ones call me
They are, we're praying
Queen's of the Stone Age and feet don't feel me
Excuse me, and before that we had the Beatles
There's a quick way to take one on the studio
So Andrew was just excuse me
Sorry about that
So really, yeah, I must really apologize
So I did see you message her later on
And I did pass it on to, to, to, to, to, to, to,
To Andrew before it before you left
But yeah, just echo your sentiment really
Yeah, he did, he did really, really well
Tonight, and I'm, I'm glad you actually sent him a DM on messenger to let him know
Because I can tell you
And I'm sure he wouldn't mind sharing with me
Everybody's set off, make theories
He's overwhelmed by, by the, kind of the important
Of support that, that he's received by, by fellow presenters
And listeners are like, and don't underestimate
The, the impact that it's had on me
He's, it really is touched by, um,
Yeah, and, you know, like you, I, I couldn't have,
I couldn't have done what he did
Just tell you 10 days after
After, and it should be proud
And I've been telling that, I just, I just hope
And these words are not falling, it's certainly about the proud
They're not falling on deaf ears
And he really, he, he really has kind of taken on board
He did, he done himself proud
And he done his mum proud, they're seeding and it really was
I was, it was a wonderful show, really was
Yeah, I saw, so could us, and, and thanks for, thanks for that message
And like I see, he, he has actually, if now he's just, he's just
And we're off to, to catch his bus now, just head in home
But I, I did make a point, I point in that message out to him
Before he left, I'm so, it's just a, myself and Federico
That's in the building at the moment Federico
Beras coming on and the next half hour for the Latin show
And, uh, it's definitely worth it
Sticking on for, on the other side of the show
I mean, they're completely opposite ends of the spectrum
If you like, for a music, but I was listening to him
On my journey home, last week at the car
And, uh, my goodness, he knows he's stuff about music
That's for sure, I mean, it's been a bit of a, you know,
Cause I like to dabble in the guitar
I mean, it was actually really quite informative, you know, so
Yeah, definitely stick around for our first show
So, it's like I say, it's worth checking it
And, but back to the show, um, we had, uh, we had a couple of tracks
Yeah, I just, uh, I couldn't help myself really, I said, there's nothing wrong with your blues
And, uh, that was our, I thought, I wrote a nice segue into a track called
Your Blues, um, by the Beatles
And we've already had a music from, uh, from Metallica on the black album
So I thought, uh, it's only, by, by way of balance
It would be only right that, uh, play something from the way to album
And, uh, he can all well
Anybody knows me knows that?
Am I better, I'll be, it was not anyway, so, so I just thought, yeah,
Can it indulge myself in that?
And, uh, the version that we had there tonight, um,
Like I said, it was from the way album, but that was the, the version, uh, had there
The Joe's Martin, uh, treatment to it, if you like, what was already an absolute terrific album
I mean, I know some people think, it's a bit of a kind of my, my album
Um, revelers don't get me wrong, revolution number nine
Number nine, uh, number nine is quite a challenging lesson
Um, but, but really, it's, uh, it's got just like, we pocket a gold dust in there
It really is, and like, as I, he said, oh, I think it, I think it's a great album
I really, really do, so I get it, I like to say, here blues
And, uh, what was already a great album, Joe's just, uh, just kind of sprinkle some,
If he's magic dust on it and just gave what already was a great album
I knew Lisa life, I mean, I'm just hearing things in it
I've never heard before, and I hope you're hearing it at home in glorious
Stereo because it's sounding absolutely terrific in the monitors here in this studio
And, uh, we followed that with, uh, what was the opening track from the album
The lens, uh, it was Queens of the Storage and feet don't feel me
And it is quite a slow burn out there, but I just like the way it builds up
And there's some sort of crescendo, it really is, you know, and, uh, we're roof
Stereo's head banging, I can't help myself when it actually breaks into, like,
What's about 90 seconds in that track, you know, it is kind of rollback and forward to that track
It really, really does
I've never been in baby in a Russian world
A man, a man who doubts a name, Johnny, it'd be good
A two-headed cow, and a fish that was, a famed by her lover
And a monkey, the toss, a boy with wings, a nice, that's hot
And a wreath of sports star, told us all about, but before it goes too
Gorgeous, and I've had time before, but friends, I'm learning from the murder court
A woman who died and came back from her home
The person who slid and slid in bed
They found the face, Jesus, all the nervous play
And snowman fell on the sunshine state
A man at the auto with his 20-third ride
A million smiling bastards who were taken for a ride
A billion dollar budget father stash a lift ass
And a holy man told us not to answer
And said, for it goes too Gorgeous, and I've had time before
But friends, I'm learning from the murder court

But we're in, I think that was Texas, I think we're in, I think we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in,

Take me back with a cold, not by myself, no more, I ain't asking for much.
I still don't take me down, take me down.
I'm just looking for some touch.
Oh, two very short tracks. They're back to back.
Writh, I do wonder if you were a showtime Bengal when we played the first of those two there.
Because they had a lot of armor, kind of playing back country Bengal there tonight.
When I dropped the T's, I had an earlier one today about the show on the Sunday Insessions Facebook page.
I did say that was going to be playing some back country.
And that was the picture and interesting, you were like, oh, I wonder where it could be.
You got a couple ideas, what could be? And a couple of suggestions actually.
So if that didn't take the box, please do send them away because we love here.
We love here. We love big cut. Well, I love here, actually. Really really enjoy myself.
That's why I don't do nights at the moment. But yeah, we love big country here at the Sunday Insessions.
And the big country there, the big country there, I'm fucking to seek.
That track, big country was lifted from the album, driving to Damascus, it was called the President slipped and fell.
And they just wrapped up a very, very successful tour of the U.S. air.
I think it's a spanned many, many states around something 20, 25 gigs or so.
But quite interesting, I'm not a one for starting room or so, but I'll just put out the facts.
I'll let you maybe join the dots, perhaps incorrectly.
But like I say, I'm just replaying the facts.
So there was a number, if you follow big country and definitely worth following on the socials.
There are Bruce Watson, there were doing a pirore, there were some video blogs.
I think that's probably what they call them, but there were certainly doing some video shots.
And there was a few back to back.
I was rather curious, they were talking at length about White China.
No, I kind of wonder. You know, does that mean something?
You know, they've got some dates lined up in the liquid rooms later this year.
The battle lines New Year's gig.
Who knows, what's the space?
I certainly don't know anything, like I say.
I'm just giving you the facts.
Do what you want with them.
Trying to dots and perhaps like me, join them completely incorrectly.
But I thought, I thought it was, it definitely raised a bit of an eye, but I went ahead
that it was talking about them.
Not one, not on, minimally, too.
There may have been three, but it wasn't just the Audra Mark and talking on one video.
It was actually a couple, maybe even three, three videos that were talking.
I thought, hmm, that's interesting.
Yeah, so anyway, like I say, I'm not wanting to start rumors.
So that was the big country, the president slept in Phil.
And we followed that with a track called Tosh.
And that was by CZ Top.
So we're going to be slowing things down a little bit.
And I know I already opened the show with some Steven Irvine.
And I can make on my main, whether it was Steven Irvine and Double Trouble or Steven Irvine.
But I can tell you, this is definitely just Steven Irvine.
Just him and a 12 string guitar.
He looked at my old friend.
Not so long ago, it was really bad.
But bit outside of the phone range.
I don't know where I'm for rowing, we started over here.
You live in a dream, though you won't stop.
But mind to think in a lot of old stuff.
That's how it's happened, living like my other drop.
Up and down and rolling and I won't ask you.
Talking about good times and singing the blues.
You and you and I stay behind.
We both knew it was best of matter of time.
Living a dream, though you won't stop.
But mind to think in a lot of old stuff.
That's how it happens, living like my other drop.
Nobody's the time we're all the day.
You're tuning up the bass and there's no easier way.
Time for my train of some man's doing it.
Got his good to be walking together, my friend.
Living a dream, though you won't stop.
But mind to think in.
That's how it happens, living like my other drop.
That's how it happens, living like my other drop.
That's how it happens, living like my other drop.
Life by the drop, by Steven Avon.
On our 12-inch 12-inch, 12-inch.
Like in a 12-inch string.
I think the guitar was bigger than 12-inch is.
Yeah, as a 12-inch string that he was playing that.
It's actually credited to all that.
I'm not aware of it, but it says it.
That was an MTV performance on the sleeve notes.
Of that album that I was lifted from, like I see,
I'm not aware of an MTV performance.
I guess I could try a little bit harder and hit the old Google
and have a little look.
Next up, I've played a band called Fanny before.
They've done an absolute terrific cover version of a Beatles track.
He's another terrific, they're all terrific.
Here's another great cover version.
This is Batch.
Think it about the times you drove in my car.
I think in that I might have drove it too far.
Then I think about the love that you let on my table.
I told you not to wander out in the dark.
I told you not the swans that they live in the park.
Then I think about the kid.
Now she's ready to wave on.
I told you not to wander out in the dark.
I told you not to wander out in the dark.

There I think about the love that you let on my table.
I think about the way I end up, early days but it's fun.
You know it's at the time I'm seeing at the time perhaps it still is I don't know what I mean I'm quite far removed from it
But it certainly back then it was it was or is a meal dominated industry so so back then
Back in 1970 that was a
That was quite a big big thing but a bit fear-plated them and that's why I'm kind of back tracking a little bit in
See anyway, it's just covers there are a lot more to covers because they they really have and it wasn't just a
They weren't just a kind of
I'm gonna say one hundred one dollar one album one that I feel like now the couple

If you're right you, you can be fine too, you can be at the same time
You were very hot and my own, my goodness, my wobbly tongue can't get my words out
That was my iron lung by Radiohead
I can't quite believe it really, I said earlier on, I thought I might have a gap if anybody wants to drop some
Some requests and I'd happily take them if they kind of fit it in the show and my goodness
There was a few tracks that didn't quite make the cut tonight, but we've got time to just shoot on one more
And before I go, like I say, feather equals just kind of set it up, it's just kind of chopping it
It's not chopping at the door, is that the door we're going to be doing a hand over real soon
But I do encourage you to kind of stick around and listen to your show, it's very, very good
And if you enjoyed tonight, hopefully you did, I've had a bold tonight
I mean the sun is out, I can't see I'm looking for the cycline home tonight
But there you go
Yeah, so please do join me next week in the end of the rock room from 6 to late
Or if you can't wait till Wednesday, join me on Tuesday from 8 to 10
We'll play some eclectic music
But until then, whatever you're doing, enjoy the sunshine because it's absolutely, absolutely marvelous day
This evening and hopefully hopefully I'll speak to you, see you again
I need to work out how to wrap up a show
I'm really, really do, I'm just mumbling here
I'm going to play out with a gate pop, this is the passenger
I am a passenger and ride a ride a ride through a city of exercise
I see the stars come out at this car
And share the ride on a hollow sky
You know it looks so good tonight
I am the passenger
I stay on your glass
I look blue my windows are bright
I see the stars come out tonight
And if the ride on a hollow sky
