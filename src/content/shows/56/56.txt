It's Tuesday evening, Kiriti is close to FM and that can mean only one thing. They're here.
Well, hopefully not because they give me the EBGBs, but I am definitely here. It's absolutely
I'm absolutely thrilled to be back. I really am. I mean it's, I've only been away for
what two, two possibly three weeks, can't quite remember. Yeah, two weeks and it feels like
I can go away for absolutely ages. So I'm absolutely chappin' at the bit to kind of share
what I think is an absolute brilliant playlist that are for you tonight. But before we get
the show on the way proper, really, by way of housekeeping, it's a bit more than actually,
I've been a bit, a bit harsh in as housekeeping. I really need to thank all the, not just for
really the last two hours, but my goodness, he's coming on leaps and bounce out tonight. Without
a single hiccup, he brought the news in tonight during the handover there. It's an absolute
credit term because you know what, 50, 50, 60 shows in, this is about 50, 60 show. A stock regularly
holds the news. So absolutely credit term, he done an absolutely terrific job. He really, really
did. And for those that are tuning in for the very first time, you may wonder what an earth
that opening sequence there was about, well, this show follows the school bill, and I
typically like to open things up with a little trip down memoryally and if you like and play
things, typically, but there's a bit of an exception this week, but it's usually some TV show
when I was in Apple. But what we actually featured tonight was a, it wasn't a TV show and it wasn't
when I was in Apple. I was a little bit older, not quite old enough to go and see it, but that was
a theme tune from from Portergeist. The movie Portergeist released back in June 1982 by Toper
and I'm simply by Toper. Steam Spielberg certainly had his, his finger prints on it, but
I thought that sounds exactly, it's unmistakable, really, a Jerry Goldsmith done an absolutely
terrific job. And really, it's hard to believe what you're listening to there.
It was music from, from a horror movie, and it really was a horror movie. I mean, like I
said, you know, I wasn't quite in the upper, when I came out, I think it was maybe what 10 or 11
and it was a double A at the time. So I think what a double A, I think that may be translate to
and you had to be 14 or 15 at the time. But my mom and dad says, not you're not getting to go and
see that. So I just did what, um, most teenage about, pre-teenage instead. I just, uh, went off on
the slide, just went my powers and went to see it. And, uh, like, it's a compacted hippie,
jeepies again. It took me a long, long time to be, uh, switching off the television when you
had all that snow going on. It really did kind of, yeah, it was a scary, scary one. But that's
a beautiful, it wasn't never all blood and go on what have you, it was just, uh, it was just like
just great cinematography. And, uh, like I say, a wonderful soundtrack. Um, so yeah, that was, uh,
and here we go, we've had a couple of texts coming in here again. Hi BGB's, um,
Hi BGB's indeed great start scary but great. That's, uh, from Colette. And, uh, thanks so much for
that, Clay's great, great, you could join me. I really, really do appreciate that. And, uh, I can
almost guarantee, as I'm going to say, uh, yeah, I'll go see it, or you get your money back. Um,
I'm pretty sure I've got something lined up for, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, something, something lined up
later on in the show that I think, uh, it's going to strike a chord with you. But I'm jumping
a bit ahead of myself before all of that, uh, is back to business as usual. And, uh, like I
say, we've got an absolute crack in playlist for it, for it tonight. Really, truly, truly a
click tick. It really is. And, um, yeah, well, let's just get started. These are the Viagra Boys.
You can't hardly breathe. You'll feel like you'll go to the top. They told you we're
just like we. That didn't get happy your first time. Wow.
Oh, we're getting up the� to swing it. That's what I'm making side effects. You need to
breathe in and out. You'll get in those beats in the shower.
To tick, it's my problem following that. They seem to agree that those control of your hands.
These magic chemicals got their fear to the river somewhere out. They just get it close.
They just get their fear to the audience. They just get it close. They just get it close.
Wow.
To work time, it could get up so stop. Check it out. You better be in there, put it in your butt.
It ain't like ever since, 20 times as strong. You'll know it's working. Where is it? It feels wrong.
Oh, they're looking for a brand new way to find my mind. I want to stop that makes me excited all the time.
They got this website, got the chemical home. They're coming to work. They said the fact you need it.
We said, got it close, got the video from right here.
We said, got it close. You better come back over here.
We said, got it close, got the video from right here.
All we said, got it close. Let's go back over here then.
We said, got it close.

I think maybe just might have been away for a wee spell and a wee bit kind of rusty I was trying
to open up Facebook page and I've managed to somehow lock myself out of their accounts
so I'm kind of grappling with kind of getting back in there and but I did see flashing
up in my watch the John Lightharts tune then he just sent a message via the Facebook page
which I'll eventually get to and he says it's great to have you back. Well thanks John because
it's truly as it's absolutely great to back to be back and last but certainly not least
there is just a time that I've seen just a time then actually that's not true reaching then
well I was actually giving my whole spiel about the phone port against and it just added the
port against there it was some movie it really really was and there actually made a bit of a
wee me cover about I think it was a bit 2014 I was certainly in the late 2000s the enemy
yeah but it just wasn't really for me anyway just just wasn't a patch on the on the original
as what was ported guys to or three for that matter absolutely terrific film and like I say the
same track just it it's just really odd you're some beautiful music for what is a quite a scary film
like I said I said the EBGB's brand conscious there are for those south of the border
they may have they may not know what the EBGB's is so that's an exercise for you all later
but it's enough to say that it's a wee bit scary yeah so yeah still can grapple and here with
with all the tech you're trying to get into to Facebook again but on the meantime just
just please bear with me if you send a message into the Sunday Insessions Facebook page over at
surprisingly enough some of the Insessions UK on Facebook I will eventually get to like I say I've just
kind of mangled mangled maxes yeah you know what they say a bit I want minute blames or tools
yeah or feeling that if you want to text a studio or if you can do both for that matter you can
text a studio on 0 7 8 35 19 20 30 and I really bad I'd love to hear for you and I have to say
that I'm talking about opening the film scene it was a double a reaction it also asked me
how are you doing is a bit of a brave man actually to ask me how was doing after the last time
he asked me and before I went off I'm not a little bit of a break I feel like I was in my
in retrospect you know it probably was a bit of a doubt thing to do but I probably
hand up the problems that I was having with my and the bus club vessels because well I know
at the time live on show Lorraine Colden I was getting bombarded with messages personal personal messages
coming WhatsApp messages coming to studio messages on Facebook as well and yeah just kind of checking
if I was okay and I am absolutely okay so yeah you're saying how I'm doing I'm absolutely fine you
know I really am they're with the breakdown they're what I'll do good but perhaps with hindsight you
know I was maybe a bit of a matter coming and I should have had the sense to kind of step back
that even and but you know I went to the docks and the docks said what you need is just some
arinar and I'm not quite sure if you meant rock and roll or wrist and recovery so I just
touched my bits and took advantage of them and done numbers I listened to some rock and roll
and had plenty of wrist and recovery so yeah like I say it's great to be back and just landing
back and yeah just getting a wheat smell on my face I mean I know the numbers you know you
could have like a thousand of whatever well the nice wee community but it's nice to see a grown
and we just reached a landmark number of a hundred Facebook likes and also a bit of a wee smell
on my face just just a couple of days ago because I was putting my playlist together and like I
see I've got an absolute terrific playlist I really do got a music from PG Harvey let me see I'm just
just flipping through my records here I'm kind of a force my show notes as well I'm not doing very well
with the tech front but I'll just go old analog stuff just flip through these some seven and
single series series some music in the mission SLF you know rather images can I give you
what's what I'll just say I'll just rattle through through them but really I'm absolutely before
I'll put it to play the next one I'm absolutely thrilled to say that it just came on my radar really
the the latest single from Scarlett Joy landed it and honestly I just became aware of it
there the weekend and I truly have a lost count of how many times I've played it is so for me it's
one of the most exciting releases for me of this year of that of that genre that's for sure so
you know I thought I'd kind of go all full tell and they were going to play three tracks by Scarlett
Joy this evening so yeah but that's a little bit later on but for now we're going to play some
egos of death metal
oh
oh
what started off is a bit of a joke name for a band the egos of death metal there and
the the founding members were just use a long lifelong friends just use and Josh home
and it's from the 1998 and to Josh home of course as they're the frontman for Queen's of the
Stone Age but certainly and the studio is his clearly very talented because he please drums as well
not just guitar and obviously sings a Queen's of the Stone Age but with he goes to the death metal
he does play drums and guitar and he's also quite handy on the other side of the dex as well because he
actually produced the album that that was littered from that was a cherry colour
of least back in really a little bit of them but I think it was 2006
nearly 2000s or something like that anyway I'm conscious that it's it's 25 past eight already I can't
believe it I've got so so much to kind of shoehorn into so without much further I do well
play this next track ahead of the adverts this is a magic adder
you better run you better not wait too long you better run you better run you better run
you better run for you have a home so let's start so let's start so let's start
turn on you better run you better run for you have a home well oh well all you know it is
oh it's so much I can't take a bear in my head and that pillow for belly of this song oh well
I'm sorry but I didn't care to wait
I'm so glad to have a home so I'm so glad to have a home so I'm so glad to have a home so I'm so glad to have a home
so why don't you run away

Featuring Sophia with craft on vocals in Gita
Tom Litham on bass and Drumeur on drums
That was a scarlet joy
That's the first of three things this evening
From Scarlet joy
That particular track was lifted from the debut album
At least back in 2022
The album was called
Marking pages
And I should add it
Morning is in morning
As in your sad
MOUR in ING
Rather than morning
I'll be sure to leave some information in the show notes
There are because
Which is a
Quite unusual with these days
You can get a physical copy of that album
Which is rather
Dickles, I find it because
Let regular listeners know that I do like my vinyl and my CDs
So yeah, like I said, we're hearing a little bit more from them
Later on in the show
I'm still grappling with the whole Facebook situation
This is a beauty about East Coast FM
Although it's
We kind of say, well, same to say, we do
We serve at East Loyand
But really because we're so high above sea level
And I don't actually know where the transmitter is
But because we're high up anyway
And the transmitter is going to be higher again
Which means I've seen this
I know I've been a way up as far as path
And I can get us no bother on the FM signal
Likewise, I've been through Glasgow
So although we're serving East Loyand
It's a sizable area of Scotland that we're covering
Of course, the flip side of that is when I'm
I'm in a mobile signal that I can log in my Facebook
Because we're so high and not quite remote
But because we're high
Do you think I can get a signal on my phone
To get the password to get into Facebook on the computers here
I'm just, please bear with me
I will get there and I don't know that John did send a message
Just saying, excuse me, like I said
I caught this flashing up on my watch
When I obviously had a brief signal
He says, it's great to have you back
Well, thanks for that, John
Because it really is great to back
And I really mean that
And I really also, he sent a text
I sent to the studio
On 0.075902030
And he's kind of really echoing John's comments
He's saying that he's glad that I'm feeling so much better now
And it's nice to hear that I'm back on there again
Well, I'm going to thank you for thanking me
You know, because it's nice to get these messages
Of support as well
Because I do wonder, you know, we haven't
Haven't been away for like a couple of weeks
It's people made just kind of drift away
Find something else to do on a
On a Tuesday evening
I was driving through thinking, well, I love islands
Finished
What else?
Arguably
Is that even worth watching on TV
But yeah, if that's your jam
That's finished
So what else can you do on a Tuesday
But listen to my ramblings
And some absolutely
Terrific music
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know your your know, you know, sitting with them when you see what I'm trying to do.
Take me to you now, show me the dream

sendo the curse of dead
The front in 1966, and despite their shortly afterwards in 1960,
it reformed again in the 1980s.
That was a UK rock group called The Creation.
That track was called The Creation.
Believe it or not, it was actually released on Creation Records.
So you have absolutely no reason to forget that if you happen to like that.
It's actually a period on a few releases over the years,
a couple of complications, but the version that we played tonight,
featured on an album called Power Punch.
That was released back in 1996.

Two tracks there, back to back
The first one was air traffic
The track called Charlotte
And that was followed by a simply now
And graphs, maps and trees
And I deliberately played them back to back
Because I was trying to think of how I could recover myself
From that reveal earlier on
Because Lorenz takes the shooting
And she said, love island
Come on Colin
Tell me you don't watch that
I'm not sure if I did see a watch there
I know I did mention it
But I think I've kind of blown my cover
Any street created ahead
I think I've lost it
But thankfully, thankfully she's not holding it against me
Because she goes on to say welcome back
And she's got that I'm feeling better
And at the moment she's driving back from North Berwick
And she's tuned in
So yeah, if that's great
Pretty heavy onboard Lorenz
And yeah, a lot more great, great music
Come on up
And that's nice, it's really, really sad
I feel like I've been seeing this
Not a lot lately, I've been absent for like
Like last couple of weeks
But certainly I'll run up to that
I remember getting all the same
And ways to say not, there's no such thing as good news anymore
Just stay away for the news
But it just seemed every time I opened up the browser
There's some other bad news
And you know, it was really, I mean, it's not, it's not, well it's critical
But hopefully it's going to turn the corner
But I was really, really saddened to hear about the news
A day of Edmunds
And I mean, can you believe it?
I mean, it was, it was only just a few weeks ago
I was actually, I played something
The day of Edmunds and I thought, you know,
I actually talked about how I'd absolutely love to see him
But just because he's getting on a bit
What is?
And he's early 80s, anyway
I thought the chances of actually seeing him are pretty slim
And even even if when he did to him
You know, it's the usual
Fooning up these ticket hotlines
And it's dating me as hard, hard getting tickets
If you want to see somebody really, really badly
But yeah, yeah, come back to the really sad news
I mean, he's still an art critically, critically ill situation
And he's fighting for his life still
Follow an art, a major cardiac arrest
And he's wife
You know, just, you know, it was quite a lengthy post
She put on Facebook
And you know, sadly, it's, well, she goes on
I'll actually quote rather me paraphrasing it
Just to keep the fact right
My beloved husband of 40 years has had a major cardiac arrest
She began and she went on to say that he did die
And around, well, she desperately tried to keep him alive
But the fact that, well, he did come back to life
Through a nurse who administered heavy CPR
She goes on to say that he's very clearly suffered
Brain damage and severe memory loss
And, like I said, unfortunately still not
Still, still, well, yeah
In critical condition, so I just hope
You know, I just hope some of these looking down
And I mean, he has a bit of a ton of the corner
I mean, I really, really do wish him well
Anyway, I thought, I just don't know, you know what?
I know, I know I played some Dave Edmunds just a few weeks ago
But I thought, he can never have too much of him
So, here's another track
This is called crawling from the wreckage
Driving like a nut in the rain
Go on, think I was acting so hysterically
But I didn't see a thing until it came
Man, the dumps of bubbles in the take away
Beating up the Chinese, the counter
I want a few inside me at the end of the day
I took out my revenge on the river
You count it's rolling on the wreckage
It's rolling from the wreckage
It's the same by now at least
I have a rainbow catch on this and it's rolling
From the wreckage to the wreckage
It's the same by now at least
A 10-minute walk in one by
I wasn't going to take any of that
Don't get tired of these about a suicide
That's all I ever hear is who I'm been
Has to crawl and come to wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Just to think I know what needs to happen
Pray my death, my message to crawl
From the wreckage to crawl
From the wreckage to crawl
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Crawling from the wreckage
Look, it's easier, I haven't let it happen before
I see it over flashes of depression
Don't drop my drink and hit some people running
Oh, the door got a mix of kind of compression
Cause when I'm distracted from the driving wheel
I'm only half the minute I should be
A middle-hitting medal is all I feel
Everything is good, as it possibly could be
From the record, from the record
You'll think when I do stand up
prices, because of queuing.
ко, today from the record
You'll sell it from the record
Than to the rainier car
Call it, come to making it
Call it, come to making it
There makes a theas,алиin' of trees
All day, the heat, it's a color
Call it, come to making it
Call it, come to making it
Continue to make it a quarter
Call it, where the record is yours
Call it, come to making it
Call it, come to making it
Call it, come to make it
Call it, come to making it
Call it and record
Call it, to make it, come to making it
Call it
The events, of course, I'm crawling from the wreckage.
No, without wanting to, to Morose, for the, for the next few songs anyway,
there is a rather unfortunate theme that can travel through them.
The next artist coming up, I'll chat back a little bit, so a good friend of my wife's,
Vicky, she was round, she was round the house there, the other weekend, she was saying,
you know, I listened to your show on Friend Yupple with it to mix clothes, and I thought,
oh, she's just, that's really nice, I thought she's just being polite, you know,
so, you know, the little devil myth, I thought, I'll kind of tease it a little bit and talk
about the show that she said to listen to, and right enough, she passed the test,
she doesn't need less into the show, so yeah, thanks for that, Vicky, anyway, we got chatting
about, she's, she's passionate about music, I am, and although they're kind of
a genre, she's got Agent Horse, so it's all the kind of the younger bands, if you
well, that she seems to lean towards, but one artist, we both shared an appreciation
for was a, was a aha, and, you know, we talked a little bit about a length about a
modern architect and has recent diagnosis with Parkinson's, and, you know, we're talking
about, I mean, I mean, if there are such things that are super fun, Vicky is that, I mean,
she's seen them, goodness knows how many times she's traveled, all over the place to see
them, and she's terrible upset with that news broke about modern, because I guess, and
I can relate, it's part of her youth, because the band have been pretty clear, the stage
that is, it's advanced enough, they'll never ever play a live again, and it's desperately
sad, really, it really is, and I'm actually, I'm pleased to say that I was fortunate enough
to actually go and see them, I have talked about, before just during the height of a heart
mania, if that's a thing, I remember it's like my mom and dad, because it was my sister,
it was more into them, my mom and dad tried to get tickets for them when they were playing
up at the Kiertel and then they couldn't get them for love and all their money, and that
was it, that was it, the time when you had to kind of queue out outside the record store,
overnight if you wanted to get tickets, and the demand was just that high, so like I said,
that was for my sister, I was, you know, I was creating interest, I was reduced by the take on
me video of course, who wasn't, you know, as the MTV generation and that video, it truly,
truly was a groundbreaking, so I did buy the album hunting on high and low at the back of that,
and I didn't enjoy it, so, you know, I was kind of more into the mission and the cult and, you
know, bands of that ilk at the time, so I kind of part of it, and then the followed that up with
the album Scoundrel days and that was me, that was a ton of point for me, I thought it was just
that was there, no longer a pop, it was music for a grown-ups, that's her, an absolute terrific album,
and yeah, so I was lucky kind of shared that sentiment and she says, and she was just
out enough tracks of that album, that she really, really enjoyed, but going back to like the
debut album, she talked about an acoustic version of take on me, and she said that she just loves
it so much, that's a funeral song, she wants that player at a funeral. Well, Vicky, if you're listening
tonight, I'm delighted to say, you're not going to have to wait till your funeral to hear it,
I've actually, I might still get a copy of this, and I'm playing this especially for you.
This is an unplugged version of hers take on me.
Say you'll say it anyway, today's another day to find you, shy in a way, I'll be coming for
you love again, take on me, take me on, I'll be gone in a day or two
so I need less to say, I'm on set ends with that's me I'm stumbling away, slowly learning
the life is okay and say after me, let's know better to be safe and sorry and I'll take on me,
take me on, I'll be gone in a day or two
and all things that you say is in life just to play my worries away
you're all the things I've got to remember your shy in a way, I'll be coming for you
in a way, take on me, take me on, I'll be gone in a day or two
and all things that you say is in life just to play my worries away
I hope you enjoyed that and like I say just an early doctor that I did say and I don't
want to be tumour also about it but it's really just in the space I'll ask for you weeks, the
amount of bad news it's coming out and really from the music industry it's just staggering
I mean it really is, there's a lot of a ton for the worst there but I think he's
I believe he's on the mend, slight stone died, Brian Wilson died, the strawberries found
they're died, I could always burn, just sad that I could go on, there's just been such a
flurry of bad news all the time like I say I'm kind of frightened to open my browser and
none more so than this next artist here I was really this is I'm going to have a stab at this
I give her our Sunday name, Conchetta Rosa Maria Franconero was very much a staple in my house
and actually in my way so stab at this house as well when she was growing up I am of course talking
about Connie Francis who sadly passed her just the 16th of July there you know but my goodness I thought
well I'll line up what can I play you know there's so so many big hits and I kind of just wanted
to go for one I kind of the deep tracks I feel like rather than the obvious ones you know like
lipstick on your collar and I was time with playing stupid Cooper then because I do have
that's a wonderful thing about music just just to focus all these memories different memories
for different people it's stupid Cooper that I remember very very clearly I was out with my mother
and father and law and Deborah my wife she was up on the karaoke singing stupid Cooper and
only a father only a father could do this without daughter you know I say I mean bless her I hope she's
not listening but yeah she'd done her best she'd done her best then but I wasn't without her dad's
active encouragement and the pop trying to encourage everybody to get up and kind of applaud
stuff like that but no I'm not gonna go for stupid Cooper I actually I know that song actually
means enough a lot to Deborah I'm so you know I dedicated one to Deborah's friend Frecky so I
think Deborah Deborah's to do a lot of time so if you're listening Deborah tonight I'll be
you know gonna give me ear ache for I'm walking your singing there but yeah hopefully I'll
redeem myself by playing this for you there's this special for you there's a track called
Among my souvenirs there's nothing left for me
I've danced that you used to be
there's a memory of my superiors
some letters died
I'll go to grab or to I see a rose from you I'm on my superiors
I'll feel you more to get dressed
or when my dress is and though they do the best to give me
a call and so a nation I can't live all the parts and there's the children's hearts
I find the broken heart of my superiors
I can't live all the parts and there's a secret start
I find the broken heart of my superiors
Welcome to my world
Won't you come on him?
Miracles, I guess.
Still happen, now and then.
Step into my heart.
Leave your cares behind.
Welcome to my world.
But with you in mind.
Lock and the door will open.
Seek and you will find.
As in you will be given.
The King to this world.
I'll be waiting here.
With my arms unfurled.
Waiting just for you.
Welcome to my world.
Waiting just for you.
Welcome to my world.
You seem to have a little bit of flurry of activity there.
I'll be at a brief signal there.
We'll get some messages there.
John's making reference to excuse me.
His choice track would be loving a boy's adventure tale.
That's a terrific track.
The time like I say I was into the more.
I'm going to go off the golf scene.
But I do remember that track.
It's good.
You know, I'll make a point.
You visit that album.
Maybe older and wise are not the rest.
Somewhat differently.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Like I say.
I haven't said it.
I had a couple of text there as well.
It's still sticking on.
He says what a beautiful version of take on me.
It's not just reimagined.
It's like a different song.
It's the same song.
Then he followed it up there with a gentleman.
Jim Reeves, of course he's talking about the other.
Who we just played just back to back there with the Connie Francis track there.
I was welcomed to my world.
He goes on to say that it was a favourite of his late parents.
And it was also a favourite of his as well.
So I'm glad that a picture box there.
It's actually, it's kind of a bit of sweet really.
Because that's song.
It means enough a lot to me.
For different reasons really at the time.
Many, many years ago.
In fact, I'm going to go back to a specific instance.
It was a bit...
Goodness.
20.
If my wife is listening.
I won't get busted.
Many years ago.
I need to get this right.
I'll just say 20 plus years ago.
We moved into our new house.
It was all really exciting.
You know, I was just a young deaf lady.
No experience in DIY at all.
I have you saw.
So there were says, I have, you know, my dad will help paint.
And she qualified that.
That helped paint actually means my dad will paint for you.
Because I'm less than a paint production in all my days.
It's just really, really wet behind the ears and all that kind of stuff.
So the agreement was he would deal with the upstairs.
And I would deal with the downstairs.
My goodness.
I'm 30.
How much?
For different reasons.
I just did not enjoy painting.
Because it wasn't the act of painting itself.
It was just...
We joined coming around.
We had to...
I'm saying we, it was just me and him.
It was in the house, step up.
It was out in the messages or something.
I don't know.
But I had to listen to his hockey dunk for several hours.
That afternoon, in fact.
And it had become a long run in joke for a long time.
But I like to say...
I listen to that...
With different aspects of it.
See it through different eyes.
But listen to it completely different.
Takes on a whole...
Like I said earlier.
It's just that.
The wonderful thing about music,
all these memories that have worked.
Just wouldn't change it for the world.

That was actually I was a jumpeal session by PG Harvey
It was a track called Omeilover
And that track ultimately ended up on the album Dry
We back in 1990
Little bit of them, I can remember
1990s
1990s something
Anyway, and before the advert was there
We had, you know, just like a CF
Keith, if you're listening, I don't know
Or if you're going to listen to the show and mix cloud
The fact that I played those two back-to-back for you
I was the first instrumental there
That was the little fingers, go for it
And then like I say, I do happen to know that
That is your favourite mission track like a child again
I did say earlier on the show that we've got three
Three tracks by Scarlett Joy this evening
And coming up we've got the second of those
This is a track from the album
Not the album called this track is called Rather
This track is called Rescue
Everything I come control
Hold it on to the side
Hold it on to the side
Hold it on to the side
Come to my side
Hold it on to my side
Hold it on to my side
Hold it on to my side
Hold it on to my side
Hold it on to my side
Hold it on to my side
Hold it on to my side
Hold it on to my side
Hold it on to my side
Hold it on to my side
Motherland
Motherland
And I'll never know, I've got to let go
And everything I can't control
Holdin' on to the time
Oh, holdin' on to the time
You're in my dark
I'm losing my mind, but I can't see anything
Well, well, I think it's real
Tell my one of them
It's so true, while I'm running
It's saying to everything
Well, well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well
Oh, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, be free
God of my turn
There is one of my mind I can't see anything
I love you, I love you
You say you don't know what I'm thinking
But so do I love you
Send to everything
When we're all defeated
You're in my time
Look at my mind, the country and everything
When we're all defeated
You're in my time
Look at my mind, the country and everything
When we're all defeated
Everything, when we're all defeated
When we're all defeated
When we're all defeated
Everything, when we're all defeated
That's Lincoln Band, Scarlett Joy, excuse me, and that was the second track
From the album Morning
Excuse me
Excuse me
That was the second track from the album
Morning pages, Swiss back in November 2022
There've not been written on the laurels at the back of that
They have actually been busy writing and recording some new materials
We're going to hear a new track just landed just the other week
Real soon
Talk a little bit more about them later on
But for note
This is, I've always struggled when I've played this band before
Is it live or is it live?
It's just the way that stylized
There's an accent above the eye
So I'm going to go with this band is called live
This is a song
Well, I guess it is
This is a song from the album Songs from the Black Mountain
This is a song
How many times can I mention the one song
This is a track
Where to be cool from here
I wanted a mountain
It gave me sea
I wanted a hurricane
It gave me a breeze
I wanted to run
Mimmy standing free
I wanted to dream
You made me sleep
I wanted to touch the bottom
It was too deep
I wanted a revolution
It said I was already free
Oh
Yeah
We'll do it
Go from here
Now the day is gone
I'll do it
Face our views
With nothing in our face
We'll do it
Go from here
Now the night has gone
I wanted to touch
You made me sleep
I wanted to run
A new place to start
I wanted to catch
You live
Oh
Oh
Yeah
Don't leave me now
Try to do that
Be sure to go
I'll do it
I'll do it
I'll do it
I'll do it
Yeah
We'll do it
Go from here
Now the day is gone
I'll do it
I'll do it
Face our views
With nothing in our face
We'll do it
Go from here
Now the night has gone
I'll do it
I'll do it
Face our views
With nothing in our face
We'll do it
I'll do it
I wanted to listen to me
I'll do it
I'll do it
I'll do it
I'll do it
I'll do it
I'll do it
Face our views
We'll do it
Go from here
Now the day is gone
I'll do it
I'll do it
I'll do it
I'm singing now, baby
Where do we go from here?
Now the night has come out
How do we face our fears?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?
I've unwittingly picked quite an up title really
When I was putting this playlist together
And genuinely this was not deliberate
Because the next track coming up
I really really was torn
Should I play it?
Should I not?
Should I?
I don't know
And so I went off on to dinner.
I've done a fair bit of reading and research
I mean, first of all, it's our dry read
But it's open to so much interpretation
The off-comrails
There isn't, I've wanted so badly to play this song
But it does drop the F-ball minute
My interpretation and I'm not going to play
In case the station manager was listening to me
Okay, because I kind of figured that I'd do it
I'm a jacket maybe on a bit of a shaky nail
But my interpretation of it is that if it's after the water shed
It does actually say, and it's all about context
You could get away with it
You know, this is the whole thing
It's all entirely subjective and somebody might
Well, the station manager might interpret it completely differently
You know, and I thought, do you know what?
The fact that I'm even looking at this is just this classic thing
If you've got to say it's not, it may be better or not
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to leave a note in the show notes
I'm not encouraging you to go off and listen to it
Now, please do stick around for the next 20 minutes or so
Because this next track is really, really good as well
It's just, it's just not really the one I wanted to play
The one I wanted to play now, I need to take a deep breath
To get this out and I catch you not
This, it's got, I mean, it must be the longest album title
There's ever been made, you know, I'm sure some day
If there are clips and again as booker records
It can maybe keep me right
But I'm going to have a stab at this in one breath
The title, the track that I wanted to play is called Get Gone
I mean, it's just, like I say, it's absolutely terrific
It really, really is
And it was a bifu and apple
And it's from the album
When the pond hits the conflict, he thinks like a king
What he knows throws the blows
When he goes to the fight and he'll win the whole thing
For he enters the ring, there's nobody
There's nobody to battle
When your mind is your might, so when you go solo
You, I'm not finished yet
You hold your own hand and remember that depth is the greatest of heights
And if you know where do you stand, then you know where to land
And if you fall it will matter because you know that you're right
Understandably, that album
It's more commonly known as when the pond dot dot dot
That's quite a mouthful
It really is
But like I said, I'll leave a link in the show notes
Because he's to check it out
Please don't go off
On to other socials, YouTube or whatever your social music from
Please just do stick around for the next 20 minutes
Because that's, well, in my opinion
It's not as strong as get gone
It's every bit as good
And it's from the album that was thankfully
It's called Extraordinary Machine
So it's not quite the mouthful
But it really for a long time
It was the album that almost never was
Because the record company had shelved it
When it was originally recorded
It mixed down the record execs
For whatever reason thought it's not commercial enough
And it was shelved for a long time
And then there was a campaign to try and
In this predates socials and what have you
So the significance of this campaign
Can't be understated
But there was a kind of internet campaign
Back then it was all about news groups
And what have you taken a free few enough from
In fact, I think it might have been cold free few enough
But it was free enough from the shackles of our record company
But in a rather bizarre twist of
Trist of faith
The record company
Relanted to a degree
If you like, albeit the said right UK
You can do the album
But you're going to have to re-record a lot
Remix and get another producer
And to do it
And so for a long time
There was two versions of the same album
But they're completely different
Circulating
I unfortunately because they are the other ones
They were leaked
They were leaked on the internet
And it's just bootleg copies that exist
There was never officially released
So I don't have that copy
I've got the what became the official record company release
From the album Extraordinary Machine
This is a track called Window
Time you was talking to me
It was a filthy pain
Of glass
I couldn't get a clear view
And as he went
All alone
It wasn't the outside world
I could see
Just the filthy pain
That I was looking through
So I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
I was never focused on just one thing
My eyes got fixed
When my mind got so
And they look like I'm contented
On a very clear view
But I'm as good as I sleep
I bet you didn't know
I take a lot of it away
If you do
I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It wasn't my way
Better that I break the window
Then forget what I had to say
Unless what I should say
Because the fact would be in there
Whatever's in front of me
It's color in my view
So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact
I only see what I'm looking through
So again I've done the right thing
I was never worried about that
The answer's always been in the preview
But even when the windows clean
Nice to fancy for the fact
That when it's clean it's so clear
I can't tell what I'm looking through
So I had to break the window
It just had to be
It wasn't my way
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It wasn't my way
Better that I break the window
Then this what I should say
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It wasn't my way
Better that I break the window
Then forget what I had to say
Unless what I should say
I'll break my heart on me
Especially me
Better that I break the window
It just had to be
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
It just had to be
You know where that was playing?
I was just coming from John
John says he must have
He really must check out
He really enjoyed that track
And he's
He's glad to know
I'm glad that I'm not alone in
Thinking that because
ever come to this side of the pond, I would pick good money to go and see her. But the chances
I think of getting to see her are pretty slim, really. But I can't know if, yeah, without going
into the detail, she's got quite a quite a backstory. Yeah, maybe I've had an exercise after
the show. You can kind of read into it. I'm not sure if I could even repeat a lot of it on the
show, such as the nature of it, it's quite a traumatic upbringing and she's had and, you know,
putting in a positive spin or if you like it, translates into some absolutely terrific music,
because that's where I think a lot of it comes from. And if you're going to check some stuff out,
she's actually had, I haven't got around to get in this yet, she had an album that was released,
I think it was just before Covid breakouts with what would that be, but 2020,
an album called Fetched The Book Cutters. So I can't comment on that, but the album that preceded it,
that was the last album I bought. Okay, that was a bit of a word day title. I don't have
not going to, I'm just in the interest, I've time, I'm not going to write a lot of the entire title,
but that became known as the idler wheel. That could be a bit of a challenging lesson.
It's good, but really for me, Fiona Apple, for beginners, there's two albums that you really
ought to gravitate to. The album that we just had, or the album that that track was lifted from,
that we just listened to, extra-ordinary machine, or like I say, when the point. And that was
certainly the first album that I came across back in 1999 when that was released. Some of the
brought it into work, so you have a lesson to this. I thought that's absolutely brilliant.
And like I say, you get going for me, there's a lot of really, really strong tracks in that,
but there's just something about the key changes in what have you in the piano, it's just really,
really good. Anyway, I talked about a abbreviating album titles in the interests of time,
I'm looking at 10 to 10, and they're making us, we've still got quite a few tracks to
kind of squeeze on before 10, but I'll do my very, very best, and we'll start with this. This is
End your Fesh.
It's suffocating, the kiss is baby, suffocating me with a burning love, suffocating me with chains around me, suffocating me with a first bit die.
It's suffocating me with a rebirth.
It's suffocating me with a conversation, suffocating me with a set of words, suffocating me with a set of love, suffocating me with a set of love.
So, for keeping me with you close for us
I love you, you're so religious
I get a thrill in the curtain calls
I feel like a wrong candle
Do you still fall in love for us?
So, keep me with you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I don't know what to do
So, keep me with you
So, keep me with you
So, keep me with you
If there was ever a story to be told about being at the right place at the right time, you'd just heard that
That was Angel Fish and suffocate me
And for those who don't know Angel Fish was really good by him as a McKenzie
I'm just with a different singer, Shirley Manson
But rather, man, make up, took a bit of a backstage, back step rather
And allow Shirley Manson to take vocals on that, which was really just a side project
And the music video for that suffocate me was just once
In the early, the small hours, the small hours on a kind of just unsain bands kind of thing
On MTV and the Butchfig happened to be watching it, caught that
And the rest of the series has to be Shirley left
Shirley left McKenzie and went on to join, joined Garbage
And, yeah, but shortly after, Shirley after that, rather, I could buy Mr McKenzie
I know that I know that they're still kicking around
Really, they did decide to call it a day and I couldn't as I can't remember the late 90s
They decided to call it a day, but they reformed really to just, it was always going to be a one-off gig
At the barrel and to mark the 30th anniversary of that debut album
Could dig in dirty rags, but after that I've been sold out, and the interest
You know, they could just see the interest hadn't waned in the band
So they reformed, and they're still playing, and they're the ones that were actually playing
Didn't, didn't wrap a whole festival there, just did the weekend
And I've seen some photos and yeah, there's a lot of people that are going to see them
And they've been down really well, so there's lots of, it's pretty much the same band
You've got their Kelly on drums, their runa scobies back in the fold on keyboards
Big John, John Duncan on guitars, Matt Mecca, of course
On vocals and their jump ready is also in a hand in
Linda, hand in hand, a helping hand, rather, on guitars
And if what I've read is, is true, he also took a played there
Now if you know this track, it will mean something to you, he played the female part
And the track, normal boy, which was performed at that during that gig, a normal boy
It's a bit of a kind of chat and response thing, it's a boy and they're originally
It was a Shirley Manson, obviously playing the girl part, and they might make a cuff
That boy, so back for the occasion of the weekend there, it was by our kids
Like I say, it was Jim Brady, that was taking vocals there
Now the talk I'll be very briefly about the final gig, I got that, I think it's very real
Because I've never seen it anywhere, and it's like hence teeth
And when it comes up on an auction site, oh my goodness
An auction site, I did not mean to say that, I just, my mouth can't keep up with my brain
And that's why that naughty world came out there
Oh dear, I mean, I should've just went with it and just played that, I feel an apple
You know what, anyway, an auction site
Yeah, you could expect to pay a pretty penny for this version of the CD that I have
Because it was a bit like a fire sale really
During the last gig, it was just like everything, I was just, it was all I could do
Like four at a time, about the T-shirts, about a couple of T-shirts
So I bought a VHS video, which was absolutely terrific, it was just full of promo videos
And I get the glass go at the green when they're supporting blondie
Lots of other stuff, but I also got this as a curious release
Because it had no front cover, but it had the back cover
And it's like misprinted as well, and I think this is why it's maybe worth a bit of cash
And yeah, it was just like, like I say, it was a CD, there's a track from that album
And it was only like I say, it was never ever for sale, it was only released or sorry
It was only for sale, rather, at that final gig, and yeah, like I say, hence teeth
From that album, the glory hole, this is called House on Fire
You'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light
You'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light

I'm going to show you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
little bit of
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of an amount of a little bit of just a little bit.
From the album glory hall, that was good buying Mr McKenzie.
I'm conscious that I've all of a run just to be able to slay there but I've got two tracks to go.
Um, but you know, uh, yeah, just I'm just going to roll with it.
I'm all ready on the naughty step, um, you know, probably get a yellow card for that.
We oopsie earlier on. So, uh, yeah, just to keep the off-completes happy, sorry about that, um, you
know, it's, uh, it's incredible. It's only earlier. I was talking about how you can see this
and you can see that, uh, you know, after my interpretation of reading the off-com
guidelines about that track, get going with a few an apple and then then a go and drop a
clanger. Uh, that's live radio for a year, suppose, isn't it? Anyway, back to the music. Um, we're
all ready over running, um, and, um, you know, I'm not helping the cause by just babbling on. So,
I did say that I was going to feature three tracks by Scarlett Joy and I've far from my money. I've
saved the very best, um, to last. This, uh, this record, this track. Well, yeah, the single came out,
uh, just last week, uh, and it was really, I was a promoter that pointed me to, uh, just on Friday,
picked it up on set. It's picked the messes up and sat out there and I was like, oh, that's just,
that just fits the mold of this show, just absolutely perfect. And, uh, honest with
the goodness, I've lost count of the amount of times that, um, that I've played it. Um, so, just
absolutely dying to share it with you all tonight. So, uh, yeah, for the first time play on here
on East Coast FM, this is Scarlett Joy. And, uh, then a single back for more.
I've run from here, oh, you've tried to.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh um uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh dat uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Get coming, I'll get coming back to you
Oh, here we go
Speaking of time, is it yours?
Oh, now I know, let's put on the arms
And it goes, oh, oh
Speaking of time, is it yours?
Oh, now I know, let's put on the arms
And it goes, oh
So I didn't think of anything
So I didn't go on and all, so I shouldn't have faith
And all I know, I don't know, if I'm sure don't
I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming,
I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep getting, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep going, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming that, I keep coming, I keep coming, I kept coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keepamped, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I kept coming, I keep getting coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, which is, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I sleeping, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, you keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming, I keep coming
to reveal this. There's actually going to be one more single that's going to be released on September
the second just before the EP eventually drops and when that EP does land I will release some
information you know on the Sunday Insessions Facebook page where you can get copies of that because
I'm likely to believe that there's likely going to be a limited edition run some CDs and possibly
even you know this said very much text my box some of the vinyl pressing of the EP but I guess we'll
just have the second see what's this piece like I say as soon as soon as I know anything I will
I will share it across the areas with you but one another piece of information that I can share
and I'll leave a second to an information in the show notes is that the next gig they've got
lined up there is a plan at the economics festival down in Lincolnshire and that's it on
the 21st of September. So if you're down in that neck you would say I do encourage you to go and
go and check them out because I could have been I've been listening to I mean that I think that
single is brilliant but it just encourage me to go and check out the back catalogue and it just doesn't
disappoint. Anyway my goodness 10 past 10 I think I just need to wrap things up here and
I just bit before I do though I just want to thank everybody who's taking the time trouble to
to message and into the studio I'm really really much appreciated it's great to know that you're
not all still there for me. I never ever take the regular lessons for granted like I say I thought
that you may have drifted away after watching Love Island and what have you and you're not
Apple Jacks I'm still wrestling me in technology you know it's certainly not working working
from it and I I still can't get on to my Facebook I'm relying on all these messages it's really
all of them getting the notifications on my I just have to have a quick glance in my watch
see the notification just memorize it couldn't commit it to memory but if I have if I have
missed anything on there I do apologize and I'll hold me commands next week when I go home and
kind of kind of kind of revisit post that I may have missed and I'll kind of write there on my ways
and but for those who who want to kind of rinse and repeat as it were if they can't quite wait
till next week I will be uploading the show to mix cloud over the next couple of days so yeah
I'll like I say I'll drop a message on there on the sundown sessions Facebook page but if
yeah until next week I'm going to play out with a track band by cigarettes after six
and this is called how you to be
you
So come in the rain of a class time
To the peaches,
Then nobody else lies
All right, can you
Put your arms around me
Take me back into that hardaway
Hardaway, hardaway
Hardaway and you
Give you love until me
Take me back into that hardaway
Hardaway, hardaway
Hardaway, hardaway
Hardaway, hardaway
Hardaway, hardaway
You're the sun's out
We're feeling it's sweetheart
Please a crush on
To find those long times
And I can see you
I can see where all the ice goes
See you sailin' across so many of the stars
For all you're in you
Put your arms around me
Take me back into that hard way
How do I handle you?
How do I end you?
Give you love until me
Take me back into that hard way
