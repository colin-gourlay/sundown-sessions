[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  We're here.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  Sweetheart, when you said they're here, who did you mean?
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  The TV people.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  Do you see them?
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  Damn.
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  Mommy!
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.000]  I can't see you all here.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  Mommy!
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.000]  I can't see you all here.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  I can't see you all here.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  I can't see you all here.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  I can't see you all here.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  I can't see you all here.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  I can't see you.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  I can't see you.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  I can't see you.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  I can't see you.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  I can't see you.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  I can't see you.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  I can't see you.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  I can't see you.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  I can't see you.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  I can't see you.
[00:58.000 --> 01:08.000]  I can't see you.
[01:58.000 --> 02:12.720]  It's Tuesday evening, Kiriti is close to FM and that can mean only one thing. They're here.
[02:12.720 --> 02:18.840]  Well, hopefully not because they give me the EBGBs, but I am definitely here. It's absolutely
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.240]  I'm absolutely thrilled to be back. I really am. I mean it's, I've only been away for
[02:23.240 --> 02:29.320]  what two, two possibly three weeks, can't quite remember. Yeah, two weeks and it feels like
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.200]  I can go away for absolutely ages. So I'm absolutely chappin' at the bit to kind of share
[02:34.200 --> 02:38.840]  what I think is an absolute brilliant playlist that are for you tonight. But before we get
[02:38.840 --> 02:43.320]  the show on the way proper, really, by way of housekeeping, it's a bit more than actually,
[02:43.320 --> 02:48.480]  I've been a bit, a bit harsh in as housekeeping. I really need to thank all the, not just for
[02:48.480 --> 02:54.480]  really the last two hours, but my goodness, he's coming on leaps and bounce out tonight. Without
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.840]  a single hiccup, he brought the news in tonight during the handover there. It's an absolute
[02:59.840 --> 03:06.480]  credit term because you know what, 50, 50, 60 shows in, this is about 50, 60 show. A stock regularly
[03:06.480 --> 03:11.920]  holds the news. So absolutely credit term, he done an absolutely terrific job. He really, really
[03:12.880 --> 03:19.600]  did. And for those that are tuning in for the very first time, you may wonder what an earth
[03:19.600 --> 03:25.600]  that opening sequence there was about, well, this show follows the school bill, and I
[03:25.600 --> 03:30.560]  typically like to open things up with a little trip down memoryally and if you like and play
[03:30.560 --> 03:35.040]  things, typically, but there's a bit of an exception this week, but it's usually some TV show
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.040]  when I was in Apple. But what we actually featured tonight was a, it wasn't a TV show and it wasn't
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.080]  when I was in Apple. I was a little bit older, not quite old enough to go and see it, but that was
[03:46.080 --> 03:54.400]  a theme tune from from Portergeist. The movie Portergeist released back in June 1982 by Toper
[03:54.400 --> 03:59.360]  and I'm simply by Toper. Steam Spielberg certainly had his, his finger prints on it, but
[03:59.360 --> 04:05.680]  I thought that sounds exactly, it's unmistakable, really, a Jerry Goldsmith done an absolutely
[04:05.680 --> 04:09.120]  terrific job. And really, it's hard to believe what you're listening to there.
[04:09.200 --> 04:14.960]  It was music from, from a horror movie, and it really was a horror movie. I mean, like I
[04:14.960 --> 04:19.520]  said, you know, I wasn't quite in the upper, when I came out, I think it was maybe what 10 or 11
[04:19.520 --> 04:24.560]  and it was a double A at the time. So I think what a double A, I think that may be translate to
[04:24.560 --> 04:29.520]  and you had to be 14 or 15 at the time. But my mom and dad says, not you're not getting to go and
[04:29.520 --> 04:37.360]  see that. So I just did what, um, most teenage about, pre-teenage instead. I just, uh, went off on
[04:37.440 --> 04:42.240]  the slide, just went my powers and went to see it. And, uh, like, it's a compacted hippie,
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.040]  jeepies again. It took me a long, long time to be, uh, switching off the television when you
[04:47.040 --> 04:52.880]  had all that snow going on. It really did kind of, yeah, it was a scary, scary one. But that's
[04:52.880 --> 04:57.040]  a beautiful, it wasn't never all blood and go on what have you, it was just, uh, it was just like
[04:57.040 --> 05:03.920]  just great cinematography. And, uh, like I say, a wonderful soundtrack. Um, so yeah, that was, uh,
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  and here we go, we've had a couple of texts coming in here again. Hi BGB's, um,
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.160]  Hi BGB's indeed great start scary but great. That's, uh, from Colette. And, uh, thanks so much for
[05:14.160 --> 05:18.560]  that, Clay's great, great, you could join me. I really, really do appreciate that. And, uh, I can
[05:18.560 --> 05:23.680]  almost guarantee, as I'm going to say, uh, yeah, I'll go see it, or you get your money back. Um,
[05:24.720 --> 05:30.080]  I'm pretty sure I've got something lined up for, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, something, something lined up
[05:30.160 --> 05:34.800]  later on in the show that I think, uh, it's going to strike a chord with you. But I'm jumping
[05:34.800 --> 05:40.320]  a bit ahead of myself before all of that, uh, is back to business as usual. And, uh, like I
[05:40.320 --> 05:45.840]  say, we've got an absolute crack in playlist for it, for it tonight. Really, truly, truly a
[05:45.840 --> 05:52.320]  click tick. It really is. And, um, yeah, well, let's just get started. These are the Viagra Boys.
[06:15.840 --> 06:43.120]  You can't hardly breathe. You'll feel like you'll go to the top. They told you we're
[06:43.120 --> 06:48.640]  just like we. That didn't get happy your first time. Wow.
[07:03.200 --> 07:10.800]  Oh, we're getting up the� to swing it. That's what I'm making side effects. You need to
[07:10.800 --> 07:16.800]  breathe in and out. You'll get in those beats in the shower.
[07:31.440 --> 07:38.320]  To tick, it's my problem following that. They seem to agree that those control of your hands.
[07:38.320 --> 07:47.120]  These magic chemicals got their fear to the river somewhere out. They just get it close.
[07:47.120 --> 07:56.320]  They just get their fear to the audience. They just get it close. They just get it close.
[08:09.280 --> 08:13.280]  Wow.
[08:13.280 --> 08:19.360]  To work time, it could get up so stop. Check it out. You better be in there, put it in your butt.
[08:20.320 --> 08:26.720]  It ain't like ever since, 20 times as strong. You'll know it's working. Where is it? It feels wrong.
[08:39.280 --> 08:47.920]  Oh, they're looking for a brand new way to find my mind. I want to stop that makes me excited all the time.
[08:47.920 --> 08:54.720]  They got this website, got the chemical home. They're coming to work. They said the fact you need it.
[08:55.040 --> 08:59.280]  We said, got it close, got the video from right here.
[09:02.080 --> 09:05.680]  We said, got it close. You better come back over here.
[09:09.040 --> 09:13.040]  We said, got it close, got the video from right here.
[09:15.680 --> 09:19.920]  All we said, got it close. Let's go back over here then.
[09:24.720 --> 09:26.720]  We said, got it close.
[09:54.720 --> 10:24.720]  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all

[12:54.720 --> 12:59.600]  I think maybe just might have been away for a wee spell and a wee bit kind of rusty I was trying
[12:59.600 --> 13:04.560]  to open up Facebook page and I've managed to somehow lock myself out of their accounts
[13:04.560 --> 13:11.040]  so I'm kind of grappling with kind of getting back in there and but I did see flashing
[13:11.040 --> 13:16.880]  up in my watch the John Lightharts tune then he just sent a message via the Facebook page
[13:16.880 --> 13:21.200]  which I'll eventually get to and he says it's great to have you back. Well thanks John because
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.600]  it's truly as it's absolutely great to back to be back and last but certainly not least
[13:27.600 --> 13:32.080]  there is just a time that I've seen just a time then actually that's not true reaching then
[13:32.080 --> 13:37.520]  well I was actually giving my whole spiel about the phone port against and it just added the
[13:37.520 --> 13:42.080]  port against there it was some movie it really really was and there actually made a bit of a
[13:42.080 --> 13:48.480]  wee me cover about I think it was a bit 2014 I was certainly in the late 2000s the enemy
[13:49.360 --> 13:54.800]  yeah but it just wasn't really for me anyway just just wasn't a patch on the on the original
[13:55.920 --> 14:01.760]  as what was ported guys to or three for that matter absolutely terrific film and like I say the
[14:01.760 --> 14:09.040]  same track just it it's just really odd you're some beautiful music for what is a quite a scary film
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.680]  like I said I said the EBGB's brand conscious there are for those south of the border
[14:15.680 --> 14:22.560]  they may have they may not know what the EBGB's is so that's an exercise for you all later
[14:22.560 --> 14:30.880]  but it's enough to say that it's a wee bit scary yeah so yeah still can grapple and here with
[14:30.880 --> 14:35.440]  with all the tech you're trying to get into to Facebook again but on the meantime just
[14:35.440 --> 14:41.680]  just please bear with me if you send a message into the Sunday Insessions Facebook page over at
[14:41.760 --> 14:48.480]  surprisingly enough some of the Insessions UK on Facebook I will eventually get to like I say I've just
[14:49.120 --> 14:56.320]  kind of mangled mangled maxes yeah you know what they say a bit I want minute blames or tools
[14:57.600 --> 15:03.200]  yeah or feeling that if you want to text a studio or if you can do both for that matter you can
[15:03.280 --> 15:10.720]  text a studio on 0 7 8 35 19 20 30 and I really bad I'd love to hear for you and I have to say
[15:10.720 --> 15:16.800]  that I'm talking about opening the film scene it was a double a reaction it also asked me
[15:17.520 --> 15:22.000]  how are you doing is a bit of a brave man actually to ask me how was doing after the last time
[15:22.000 --> 15:30.720]  he asked me and before I went off I'm not a little bit of a break I feel like I was in my
[15:31.040 --> 15:35.680]  in retrospect you know it probably was a bit of a doubt thing to do but I probably
[15:35.680 --> 15:43.920]  hand up the problems that I was having with my and the bus club vessels because well I know
[15:43.920 --> 15:51.360]  at the time live on show Lorraine Colden I was getting bombarded with messages personal personal messages
[15:51.360 --> 15:58.960]  coming WhatsApp messages coming to studio messages on Facebook as well and yeah just kind of checking
[15:58.960 --> 16:08.480]  if I was okay and I am absolutely okay so yeah you're saying how I'm doing I'm absolutely fine you
[16:08.480 --> 16:12.960]  know I really am they're with the breakdown they're what I'll do good but perhaps with hindsight you
[16:12.960 --> 16:17.040]  know I was maybe a bit of a matter coming and I should have had the sense to kind of step back
[16:17.040 --> 16:22.320]  that even and but you know I went to the docks and the docks said what you need is just some
[16:22.320 --> 16:27.040]  arinar and I'm not quite sure if you meant rock and roll or wrist and recovery so I just
[16:27.120 --> 16:31.840]  touched my bits and took advantage of them and done numbers I listened to some rock and roll
[16:31.840 --> 16:38.320]  and had plenty of wrist and recovery so yeah like I say it's great to be back and just landing
[16:38.320 --> 16:46.320]  back and yeah just getting a wheat smell on my face I mean I know the numbers you know you
[16:46.320 --> 16:50.640]  could have like a thousand of whatever well the nice wee community but it's nice to see a grown
[16:50.640 --> 16:56.800]  and we just reached a landmark number of a hundred Facebook likes and also a bit of a wee smell
[16:56.800 --> 17:02.320]  on my face just just a couple of days ago because I was putting my playlist together and like I
[17:02.320 --> 17:09.760]  see I've got an absolute terrific playlist I really do got a music from PG Harvey let me see I'm just
[17:09.760 --> 17:17.600]  just flipping through my records here I'm kind of a force my show notes as well I'm not doing very well
[17:17.600 --> 17:23.840]  with the tech front but I'll just go old analog stuff just flip through these some seven and
[17:23.840 --> 17:32.880]  single series series some music in the mission SLF you know rather images can I give you
[17:32.880 --> 17:37.200]  what's what I'll just say I'll just rattle through through them but really I'm absolutely before
[17:37.200 --> 17:42.240]  I'll put it to play the next one I'm absolutely thrilled to say that it just came on my radar really
[17:42.560 --> 17:47.600]  the the latest single from Scarlett Joy landed it and honestly I just became aware of it
[17:47.600 --> 17:53.280]  there the weekend and I truly have a lost count of how many times I've played it is so for me it's
[17:53.280 --> 17:59.680]  one of the most exciting releases for me of this year of that of that genre that's for sure so
[17:59.680 --> 18:05.040]  you know I thought I'd kind of go all full tell and they were going to play three tracks by Scarlett
[18:05.040 --> 18:10.880]  Joy this evening so yeah but that's a little bit later on but for now we're going to play some
[18:10.880 --> 18:12.880]  egos of death metal
[20:40.880 --> 20:42.880]  oh
[21:10.880 --> 21:12.880]  oh
[21:31.680 --> 21:37.120]  what started off is a bit of a joke name for a band the egos of death metal there and
[21:38.080 --> 21:43.040]  the the founding members were just use a long lifelong friends just use and Josh home
[21:44.400 --> 21:50.480]  and it's from the 1998 and to Josh home of course as they're the frontman for Queen's of the
[21:50.480 --> 21:58.240]  Stone Age but certainly and the studio is his clearly very talented because he please drums as well
[21:58.240 --> 22:03.360]  not just guitar and obviously sings a Queen's of the Stone Age but with he goes to the death metal
[22:03.440 --> 22:09.440]  he does play drums and guitar and he's also quite handy on the other side of the dex as well because he
[22:09.440 --> 22:13.440]  actually produced the album that that was littered from that was a cherry colour
[22:15.680 --> 22:20.320]  of least back in really a little bit of them but I think it was 2006
[22:20.320 --> 22:29.680]  nearly 2000s or something like that anyway I'm conscious that it's it's 25 past eight already I can't
[22:29.680 --> 22:35.200]  believe it I've got so so much to kind of shoehorn into so without much further I do well
[22:35.200 --> 22:39.200]  play this next track ahead of the adverts this is a magic adder
[23:30.640 --> 23:55.520]  you better run you better not wait too long you better run you better run you better run
[23:55.520 --> 24:07.040]  you better run for you have a home so let's start so let's start so let's start
[24:07.040 --> 24:25.840]  turn on you better run you better run for you have a home well oh well all you know it is

[34:48.140 --> 34:51.140]  Tom Litham on bass and Drumeur on drums
[34:51.140 --> 34:53.140]  That was a scarlet joy
[34:53.140 --> 34:56.140]  That's the first of three things this evening
[34:56.140 --> 34:58.140]  From Scarlet joy
[34:58.140 --> 35:01.140]  That particular track was lifted from the debut album
[35:01.140 --> 35:03.140]  At least back in 2022
[35:03.140 --> 35:05.140]  The album was called
[35:05.140 --> 35:07.140]  Marking pages
[35:07.140 --> 35:08.140]  And I should add it
[35:08.140 --> 35:10.140]  Morning is in morning
[35:10.140 --> 35:11.140]  As in your sad
[35:11.140 --> 35:13.140]  MOUR in ING
[35:13.140 --> 35:15.140]  Rather than morning
[35:15.140 --> 35:19.140]  I'll be sure to leave some information in the show notes
[35:19.140 --> 35:20.140]  There are because
[35:20.140 --> 35:22.140]  Which is a
[35:22.140 --> 35:24.140]  Quite unusual with these days
[35:24.140 --> 35:27.140]  You can get a physical copy of that album
[35:27.140 --> 35:28.140]  Which is rather
[35:28.140 --> 35:30.140]  Dickles, I find it because
[35:30.140 --> 35:34.140]  Let regular listeners know that I do like my vinyl and my CDs
[35:34.140 --> 35:37.140]  So yeah, like I said, we're hearing a little bit more from them
[35:37.140 --> 35:39.140]  Later on in the show
[35:39.140 --> 35:44.140]  I'm still grappling with the whole Facebook situation
[35:44.140 --> 35:46.140]  This is a beauty about East Coast FM
[35:46.140 --> 35:48.140]  Although it's
[35:49.140 --> 35:52.140]  We kind of say, well, same to say, we do
[35:52.140 --> 35:54.140]  We serve at East Loyand
[35:54.140 --> 35:57.140]  But really because we're so high above sea level
[35:57.140 --> 36:00.140]  And I don't actually know where the transmitter is
[36:00.140 --> 36:02.140]  But because we're high up anyway
[36:02.140 --> 36:05.140]  And the transmitter is going to be higher again
[36:05.140 --> 36:07.140]  Which means I've seen this
[36:07.140 --> 36:09.140]  I know I've been a way up as far as path
[36:09.140 --> 36:13.140]  And I can get us no bother on the FM signal
[36:13.140 --> 36:15.140]  Likewise, I've been through Glasgow
[36:15.140 --> 36:18.140]  So although we're serving East Loyand
[36:18.140 --> 36:23.140]  It's a sizable area of Scotland that we're covering
[36:23.140 --> 36:25.140]  Of course, the flip side of that is when I'm
[36:25.140 --> 36:28.140]  I'm in a mobile signal that I can log in my Facebook
[36:28.140 --> 36:31.140]  Because we're so high and not quite remote
[36:31.140 --> 36:32.140]  But because we're high
[36:32.140 --> 36:34.140]  Do you think I can get a signal on my phone
[36:34.140 --> 36:39.140]  To get the password to get into Facebook on the computers here
[36:39.140 --> 36:41.140]  I'm just, please bear with me
[36:42.140 --> 36:45.140]  I will get there and I don't know that John did send a message
[36:45.140 --> 36:47.140]  Just saying, excuse me, like I said
[36:47.140 --> 36:49.140]  I caught this flashing up on my watch
[36:49.140 --> 36:52.140]  When I obviously had a brief signal
[36:52.140 --> 36:54.140]  He says, it's great to have you back
[36:54.140 --> 36:56.140]  Well, thanks for that, John
[36:56.140 --> 36:58.140]  Because it really is great to back
[36:58.140 --> 36:59.140]  And I really mean that
[36:59.140 --> 37:02.140]  And I really also, he sent a text
[37:02.140 --> 37:04.140]  I sent to the studio
[37:04.140 --> 37:07.140]  On 0.075902030
[37:08.140 --> 37:10.140]  And he's kind of really echoing John's comments
[37:10.140 --> 37:14.140]  He's saying that he's glad that I'm feeling so much better now
[37:14.140 --> 37:17.140]  And it's nice to hear that I'm back on there again
[37:17.140 --> 37:20.140]  Well, I'm going to thank you for thanking me
[37:20.140 --> 37:23.140]  You know, because it's nice to get these messages
[37:23.140 --> 37:24.140]  Of support as well
[37:24.140 --> 37:26.140]  Because I do wonder, you know, we haven't
[37:26.140 --> 37:28.140]  Haven't been away for like a couple of weeks
[37:28.140 --> 37:30.140]  It's people made just kind of drift away
[37:30.140 --> 37:32.140]  Find something else to do on a
[37:32.140 --> 37:33.140]  On a Tuesday evening
[37:34.140 --> 37:36.140]  I was driving through thinking, well, I love islands
[37:36.140 --> 37:37.140]  Finished
[37:37.140 --> 37:38.140]  What else?
[37:38.140 --> 37:39.140]  Arguably
[37:39.140 --> 37:41.140]  Is that even worth watching on TV
[37:41.140 --> 37:44.140]  But yeah, if that's your jam
[37:44.140 --> 37:45.140]  That's finished
[37:45.140 --> 37:47.140]  So what else can you do on a Tuesday
[37:47.140 --> 37:49.140]  But listen to my ramblings
[37:49.140 --> 37:50.140]  And some absolutely
[37:50.140 --> 37:52.140]  Terrific music
[38:03.140 --> 38:33.140]  You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
[38:33.140 --> 38:46.540]  you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know your your know, you know, sitting with them when you see what I'm trying to do.
[39:16.540 --> 39:24.540]  Take me to you now, show me the dream
[39:24.540 --> 39:32.540]  Part of our life, oh, there you are, there you are, there you are
[39:32.540 --> 39:39.540]  In this place, in this place, in this place
[39:39.540 --> 39:47.540]  In this place, in this place
[40:02.540 --> 40:06.540]  In this place, in this place, in this place
[40:06.540 --> 40:07.540]  In this place, in this place
[40:07.540 --> 40:09.540]  In this place, in this place, in this place
[40:09.540 --> 40:13.540]  In this place, in this place
[40:13.540 --> 40:18.540]  In this place, in this place
[40:18.540 --> 40:21.540]  In this area, in this place
[40:21.540 --> 40:26.540]  Over there, where it all is right
[40:26.540 --> 40:31.540]  sendo the curse of dead
[40:31.540 --> 41:01.440]  The front in 1966, and despite their shortly afterwards in 1960,
[41:01.440 --> 41:04.440]  it reformed again in the 1980s.
[41:04.440 --> 41:09.440]  That was a UK rock group called The Creation.
[41:09.440 --> 41:12.440]  That track was called The Creation.
[41:12.440 --> 41:16.440]  Believe it or not, it was actually released on Creation Records.
[41:16.440 --> 41:21.440]  So you have absolutely no reason to forget that if you happen to like that.
[41:21.440 --> 41:25.440]  It's actually a period on a few releases over the years,
[41:25.440 --> 41:29.440]  a couple of complications, but the version that we played tonight,
[41:29.440 --> 41:31.440]  featured on an album called Power Punch.
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.440]  That was released back in 1996.

[45:16.440 --> 45:24.880]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, that yeah
[45:46.440 --> 46:03.440]  Music
[46:08.040 --> 46:13.240]  One with no abstain.
[46:13.240 --> 46:18.240]  I'm chillin' for nothing, come on
[46:19.240 --> 46:24.240]  Now we will place this
[46:24.240 --> 46:28.240]  Make it up, make it as we go to your hand
[46:28.240 --> 46:31.240]  Take in a photo, set the installs
[46:31.240 --> 46:33.240]  Down on the south bank
[46:33.240 --> 46:39.240]  As you bust, make it up, make it as we go to your hand
[46:39.240 --> 46:44.240]  Take in a photo, set the installs down on the south bank
[46:44.240 --> 46:49.240]  As you bust, make it up, make it as we go to your hand
[46:49.240 --> 46:51.240]  Now we will place this installs
[46:51.240 --> 46:53.240]  Down on the south bank
[46:53.240 --> 46:58.240]  As you bust, make it as we go to your hand
[46:58.240 --> 47:02.240]  Now we will place this installs
[47:02.240 --> 47:05.240]  Down on the south bank
[47:05.240 --> 47:13.240]  As you bust, make it as we go to your hand
[47:13.240 --> 47:15.240]  Two tracks there, back to back
[47:15.240 --> 47:17.240]  The first one was air traffic
[47:17.240 --> 47:19.240]  The track called Charlotte
[47:19.240 --> 47:21.240]  And that was followed by a simply now
[47:21.240 --> 47:23.240]  And graphs, maps and trees
[47:23.240 --> 47:25.240]  And I deliberately played them back to back
[47:25.240 --> 47:28.240]  Because I was trying to think of how I could recover myself
[47:28.240 --> 47:31.240]  From that reveal earlier on
[47:31.240 --> 47:33.240]  Because Lorenz takes the shooting
[47:33.240 --> 47:35.240]  And she said, love island
[47:35.240 --> 47:36.240]  Come on Colin
[47:36.240 --> 47:38.240]  Tell me you don't watch that
[47:38.240 --> 47:40.240]  I'm not sure if I did see a watch there
[47:40.240 --> 47:42.240]  I know I did mention it
[47:42.240 --> 47:45.240]  But I think I've kind of blown my cover
[47:45.240 --> 47:47.240]  Any street created ahead
[47:47.240 --> 47:49.240]  I think I've lost it
[47:49.240 --> 47:52.240]  But thankfully, thankfully she's not holding it against me
[47:52.240 --> 47:54.240]  Because she goes on to say welcome back
[47:54.240 --> 47:56.240]  And she's got that I'm feeling better
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.240]  And at the moment she's driving back from North Berwick
[48:00.240 --> 48:01.240]  And she's tuned in
[48:01.240 --> 48:03.240]  So yeah, if that's great
[48:03.240 --> 48:05.240]  Pretty heavy onboard Lorenz
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.240]  And yeah, a lot more great, great music
[48:09.240 --> 48:11.240]  Come on up
[48:11.240 --> 48:14.240]  And that's nice, it's really, really sad
[48:14.240 --> 48:17.240]  I feel like I've been seeing this
[48:17.240 --> 48:20.240]  Not a lot lately, I've been absent for like
[48:20.240 --> 48:21.240]  Like last couple of weeks
[48:21.240 --> 48:22.240]  But certainly I'll run up to that
[48:22.240 --> 48:25.240]  I remember getting all the same
[48:25.240 --> 48:28.240]  And ways to say not, there's no such thing as good news anymore
[48:28.240 --> 48:30.240]  Just stay away for the news
[48:30.240 --> 48:33.240]  But it just seemed every time I opened up the browser
[48:33.240 --> 48:36.240]  There's some other bad news
[48:36.240 --> 48:41.240]  And you know, it was really, I mean, it's not, it's not, well it's critical
[48:41.240 --> 48:43.240]  But hopefully it's going to turn the corner
[48:43.240 --> 48:46.240]  But I was really, really saddened to hear about the news
[48:46.240 --> 48:47.240]  A day of Edmunds
[48:47.240 --> 48:49.240]  And I mean, can you believe it?
[48:49.240 --> 48:52.240]  I mean, it was, it was only just a few weeks ago
[48:52.240 --> 48:54.240]  I was actually, I played something
[48:54.240 --> 48:56.240]  The day of Edmunds and I thought, you know,
[48:56.240 --> 48:59.240]  I actually talked about how I'd absolutely love to see him
[48:59.240 --> 49:01.240]  But just because he's getting on a bit
[49:01.240 --> 49:02.240]  What is?
[49:02.240 --> 49:04.240]  And he's early 80s, anyway
[49:04.240 --> 49:06.240]  I thought the chances of actually seeing him are pretty slim
[49:06.240 --> 49:10.240]  And even even if when he did to him
[49:10.240 --> 49:12.240]  You know, it's the usual
[49:12.240 --> 49:15.240]  Fooning up these ticket hotlines
[49:15.240 --> 49:18.240]  And it's dating me as hard, hard getting tickets
[49:18.240 --> 49:20.240]  If you want to see somebody really, really badly
[49:20.240 --> 49:24.240]  But yeah, yeah, come back to the really sad news
[49:24.240 --> 49:29.240]  I mean, he's still an art critically, critically ill situation
[49:29.240 --> 49:32.240]  And he's fighting for his life still
[49:32.240 --> 49:34.240]  Follow an art, a major cardiac arrest
[49:34.240 --> 49:36.240]  And he's wife
[49:36.240 --> 49:39.240]  You know, just, you know, it was quite a lengthy post
[49:39.240 --> 49:41.240]  She put on Facebook
[49:41.240 --> 49:45.240]  And you know, sadly, it's, well, she goes on
[49:45.240 --> 49:47.240]  I'll actually quote rather me paraphrasing it
[49:47.240 --> 49:50.240]  Just to keep the fact right
[49:50.240 --> 49:53.240]  My beloved husband of 40 years has had a major cardiac arrest
[49:53.240 --> 49:57.240]  She began and she went on to say that he did die
[49:57.240 --> 50:01.240]  And around, well, she desperately tried to keep him alive
[50:01.240 --> 50:04.240]  But the fact that, well, he did come back to life
[50:04.240 --> 50:08.240]  Through a nurse who administered heavy CPR
[50:08.240 --> 50:12.240]  She goes on to say that he's very clearly suffered
[50:12.240 --> 50:15.240]  Brain damage and severe memory loss
[50:15.240 --> 50:18.240]  And, like I said, unfortunately still not
[50:18.240 --> 50:21.240]  Still, still, well, yeah
[50:21.240 --> 50:24.240]  In critical condition, so I just hope
[50:24.240 --> 50:27.240]  You know, I just hope some of these looking down
[50:27.240 --> 50:29.240]  And I mean, he has a bit of a ton of the corner
[50:29.240 --> 50:31.240]  I mean, I really, really do wish him well
[50:31.240 --> 50:34.240]  Anyway, I thought, I just don't know, you know what?
[50:34.240 --> 50:37.240]  I know, I know I played some Dave Edmunds just a few weeks ago
[50:37.240 --> 50:39.240]  But I thought, he can never have too much of him
[50:39.240 --> 50:40.240]  So, here's another track
[50:40.240 --> 50:42.240]  This is called crawling from the wreckage
[50:51.240 --> 50:53.240]  Driving like a nut in the rain
[50:53.240 --> 50:56.240]  Go on, think I was acting so hysterically
[50:56.240 --> 50:59.240]  But I didn't see a thing until it came
[50:59.240 --> 51:02.240]  Man, the dumps of bubbles in the take away
[51:02.240 --> 51:05.240]  Beating up the Chinese, the counter
[51:05.240 --> 51:08.240]  I want a few inside me at the end of the day
[51:08.240 --> 51:11.240]  I took out my revenge on the river
[51:11.240 --> 51:13.240]  You count it's rolling on the wreckage
[51:13.240 --> 51:14.240]  It's rolling from the wreckage
[51:14.240 --> 51:16.240]  It's the same by now at least
[51:16.240 --> 51:18.240]  I have a rainbow catch on this and it's rolling
[51:18.240 --> 51:20.240]  From the wreckage to the wreckage
[51:20.240 --> 51:24.240]  It's the same by now at least
[51:24.240 --> 51:38.860]  A 10-minute walk in one by
[51:38.860 --> 51:41.860]  I wasn't going to take any of that
[51:41.860 --> 51:44.860]  Don't get tired of these about a suicide
[51:44.860 --> 51:47.860]  That's all I ever hear is who I'm been
[51:47.860 --> 51:49.860]  Has to crawl and come to wreckage
[51:49.860 --> 51:50.860]  Crawling from the wreckage
[51:50.860 --> 51:52.860]  Just to think I know what needs to happen
[51:52.860 --> 51:54.860]  Pray my death, my message to crawl
[51:54.860 --> 51:55.860]  From the wreckage to crawl
[51:55.860 --> 51:59.860]  From the wreckage to crawl
[51:59.860 --> 52:02.860]  Crawling from the wreckage
[52:02.860 --> 52:06.860]  Crawling from the wreckage
[52:06.860 --> 52:07.860]  Crawling from the wreckage
[52:07.860 --> 52:25.860]  Crawling from the wreckage
[52:25.860 --> 52:29.860]  Crawling from the wreckage
[52:29.860 --> 52:36.860]  Crawling from the wreckage
[52:36.860 --> 52:39.660]  Look, it's easier, I haven't let it happen before
[52:39.660 --> 52:42.260]  I see it over flashes of depression
[52:42.260 --> 52:44.660]  Don't drop my drink and hit some people running
[52:44.660 --> 52:48.260]  Oh, the door got a mix of kind of compression
[52:48.260 --> 52:51.260]  Cause when I'm distracted from the driving wheel
[52:51.260 --> 52:54.260]  I'm only half the minute I should be
[52:54.260 --> 52:57.260]  A middle-hitting medal is all I feel
[52:57.260 --> 53:00.260]  Everything is good, as it possibly could be
[53:00.260 --> 53:03.060]  From the record, from the record
[53:03.160 --> 53:04.460]  You'll think when I do stand up
[53:04.460 --> 53:05.860]  prices, because of queuing.
[53:05.860 --> 53:07.160] ко, today from the record
[53:07.160 --> 53:08.760]  You'll sell it from the record
[53:08.760 --> 53:11.560]  Than to the rainier car
[53:11.560 --> 53:13.280]  Call it, come to making it
[53:13.280 --> 53:14.760]  Call it, come to making it
[53:14.760 --> 53:16.260]  There makes a theas,алиin' of trees
[53:16.260 --> 53:17.760]  All day, the heat, it's a color
[53:17.760 --> 53:18.760]  Call it, come to making it
[53:18.760 --> 53:20.360]  Call it, come to making it
[53:20.360 --> 53:23.560]  Continue to make it a quarter
[53:23.660 --> 53:25.260]  Call it, where the record is yours
[53:25.260 --> 53:26.360]  Call it, come to making it
[53:26.360 --> 53:27.740]  Call it, come to making it
[53:27.740 --> 53:28.960]  Call it, come to make it
[53:28.960 --> 53:29.760]  Call it, come to making it
[53:29.760 --> 53:31.500]  Call it and record
[53:31.500 --> 53:32.220]  Call it, to make it, come to making it
[53:32.220 --> 53:32.600]  Call it
[53:33.060 --> 53:37.420]  The events, of course, I'm crawling from the wreckage.
[53:37.420 --> 53:42.260]  No, without wanting to, to Morose, for the, for the next few songs anyway,
[53:42.260 --> 53:46.460]  there is a rather unfortunate theme that can travel through them.
[53:46.460 --> 53:53.100]  The next artist coming up, I'll chat back a little bit, so a good friend of my wife's,
[53:53.100 --> 53:58.580]  Vicky, she was round, she was round the house there, the other weekend, she was saying,
[53:58.580 --> 54:03.140]  you know, I listened to your show on Friend Yupple with it to mix clothes, and I thought,
[54:03.140 --> 54:07.620]  oh, she's just, that's really nice, I thought she's just being polite, you know,
[54:07.620 --> 54:11.660]  so, you know, the little devil myth, I thought, I'll kind of tease it a little bit and talk
[54:11.660 --> 54:15.820]  about the show that she said to listen to, and right enough, she passed the test,
[54:15.820 --> 54:21.020]  she doesn't need less into the show, so yeah, thanks for that, Vicky, anyway, we got chatting
[54:21.020 --> 54:27.500]  about, she's, she's passionate about music, I am, and although they're kind of
[54:27.500 --> 54:34.500]  a genre, she's got Agent Horse, so it's all the kind of the younger bands, if you
[54:34.500 --> 54:42.460]  well, that she seems to lean towards, but one artist, we both shared an appreciation
[54:42.460 --> 54:48.180]  for was a, was a aha, and, you know, we talked a little bit about a length about a
[54:48.180 --> 54:55.220]  modern architect and has recent diagnosis with Parkinson's, and, you know, we're talking
[54:55.220 --> 55:01.060]  about, I mean, I mean, if there are such things that are super fun, Vicky is that, I mean,
[55:01.060 --> 55:04.340]  she's seen them, goodness knows how many times she's traveled, all over the place to see
[55:04.340 --> 55:09.220]  them, and she's terrible upset with that news broke about modern, because I guess, and
[55:09.220 --> 55:16.660]  I can relate, it's part of her youth, because the band have been pretty clear, the stage
[55:16.660 --> 55:23.180]  that is, it's advanced enough, they'll never ever play a live again, and it's desperately
[55:23.260 --> 55:30.060]  sad, really, it really is, and I'm actually, I'm pleased to say that I was fortunate enough
[55:30.060 --> 55:34.460]  to actually go and see them, I have talked about, before just during the height of a heart
[55:34.460 --> 55:40.060]  mania, if that's a thing, I remember it's like my mom and dad, because it was my sister,
[55:40.060 --> 55:43.660]  it was more into them, my mom and dad tried to get tickets for them when they were playing
[55:43.660 --> 55:47.420]  up at the Kiertel and then they couldn't get them for love and all their money, and that
[55:47.420 --> 55:51.820]  was it, that was it, the time when you had to kind of queue out outside the record store,
[55:52.140 --> 55:59.740]  overnight if you wanted to get tickets, and the demand was just that high, so like I said,
[55:59.740 --> 56:04.940]  that was for my sister, I was, you know, I was creating interest, I was reduced by the take on
[56:04.940 --> 56:11.260]  me video of course, who wasn't, you know, as the MTV generation and that video, it truly,
[56:11.260 --> 56:16.460]  truly was a groundbreaking, so I did buy the album hunting on high and low at the back of that,
[56:16.540 --> 56:23.580]  and I didn't enjoy it, so, you know, I was kind of more into the mission and the cult and, you
[56:23.580 --> 56:28.780]  know, bands of that ilk at the time, so I kind of part of it, and then the followed that up with
[56:29.740 --> 56:33.820]  the album Scoundrel days and that was me, that was a ton of point for me, I thought it was just
[56:33.820 --> 56:39.260]  that was there, no longer a pop, it was music for a grown-ups, that's her, an absolute terrific album,
[56:39.260 --> 56:43.980]  and yeah, so I was lucky kind of shared that sentiment and she says, and she was just
[56:43.980 --> 56:50.060]  out enough tracks of that album, that she really, really enjoyed, but going back to like the
[56:50.060 --> 57:00.460]  debut album, she talked about an acoustic version of take on me, and she said that she just loves
[57:00.460 --> 57:06.700]  it so much, that's a funeral song, she wants that player at a funeral. Well, Vicky, if you're listening
[57:06.700 --> 57:11.260]  tonight, I'm delighted to say, you're not going to have to wait till your funeral to hear it,
[57:11.340 --> 57:15.820]  I've actually, I might still get a copy of this, and I'm playing this especially for you.
[57:15.820 --> 57:20.860]  This is an unplugged version of hers take on me.
[57:41.260 --> 57:54.460]  Say you'll say it anyway, today's another day to find you, shy in a way, I'll be coming for
[57:54.460 --> 58:23.100]  you love again, take on me, take me on, I'll be gone in a day or two
[58:25.420 --> 58:38.460]  so I need less to say, I'm on set ends with that's me I'm stumbling away, slowly learning
[58:38.460 --> 58:52.540]  the life is okay and say after me, let's know better to be safe and sorry and I'll take on me,
[58:52.540 --> 59:15.980]  take me on, I'll be gone in a day or two
[59:22.540 --> 59:52.380]  and all things that you say is in life just to play my worries away
[59:52.380 --> 01:00:01.740]  you're all the things I've got to remember your shy in a way, I'll be coming for you
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:31.180]  in a way, take on me, take me on, I'll be gone in a day or two
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:49.900]  and all things that you say is in life just to play my worries away
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:01:06.300]  I hope you enjoyed that and like I say just an early doctor that I did say and I don't
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:11.260]  want to be tumour also about it but it's really just in the space I'll ask for you weeks, the
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:17.980]  amount of bad news it's coming out and really from the music industry it's just staggering
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:26.860]  I mean it really is, there's a lot of a ton for the worst there but I think he's
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:33.660]  I believe he's on the mend, slight stone died, Brian Wilson died, the strawberries found
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:39.180]  they're died, I could always burn, just sad that I could go on, there's just been such a
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:45.180]  flurry of bad news all the time like I say I'm kind of frightened to open my browser and
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:52.860]  none more so than this next artist here I was really this is I'm going to have a stab at this
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:02:01.260]  I give her our Sunday name, Conchetta Rosa Maria Franconero was very much a staple in my house
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:07.260]  and actually in my way so stab at this house as well when she was growing up I am of course talking
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:16.860]  about Connie Francis who sadly passed her just the 16th of July there you know but my goodness I thought
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:23.660]  well I'll line up what can I play you know there's so so many big hits and I kind of just wanted
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:29.020]  to go for one I kind of the deep tracks I feel like rather than the obvious ones you know like
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:35.180]  lipstick on your collar and I was time with playing stupid Cooper then because I do have
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:42.380]  that's a wonderful thing about music just just to focus all these memories different memories
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:47.660]  for different people it's stupid Cooper that I remember very very clearly I was out with my mother
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:53.580]  and father and law and Deborah my wife she was up on the karaoke singing stupid Cooper and
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.820]  only a father only a father could do this without daughter you know I say I mean bless her I hope she's
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:05.660]  not listening but yeah she'd done her best she'd done her best then but I wasn't without her dad's
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:10.060]  active encouragement and the pop trying to encourage everybody to get up and kind of applaud
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:16.380]  stuff like that but no I'm not gonna go for stupid Cooper I actually I know that song actually
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:22.860]  means enough a lot to Deborah I'm so you know I dedicated one to Deborah's friend Frecky so I
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:28.780]  think Deborah Deborah's to do a lot of time so if you're listening Deborah tonight I'll be
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:34.060]  you know gonna give me ear ache for I'm walking your singing there but yeah hopefully I'll
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.140]  redeem myself by playing this for you there's this special for you there's a track called
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:48.380]  Among my souvenirs there's nothing left for me
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:54.220]  I've danced that you used to be
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:06.460]  there's a memory of my superiors
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:13.580]  some letters died
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:32.380]  I'll go to grab or to I see a rose from you I'm on my superiors
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:42.460]  I'll feel you more to get dressed
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:57.580]  or when my dress is and though they do the best to give me
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:18.780]  a call and so a nation I can't live all the parts and there's the children's hearts
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:31.580]  I find the broken heart of my superiors
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:45.260]  I can't live all the parts and there's a secret start
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:06:00.220]  I find the broken heart of my superiors
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:30.460]  Welcome to my world
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:35.460]  Won't you come on him?
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:41.460]  Miracles, I guess.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:47.460]  Still happen, now and then.
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:53.460]  Step into my heart.
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:59.460]  Leave your cares behind.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:06.460]  Welcome to my world.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:13.460]  But with you in mind.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:19.460]  Lock and the door will open.
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:25.460]  Seek and you will find.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:30.460]  As in you will be given.
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:38.460]  The King to this world.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:44.460]  I'll be waiting here.
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:50.460]  With my arms unfurled.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:54.460]  Waiting just for you.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:02.460]  Welcome to my world.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:18.460]  Waiting just for you.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:25.460]  Welcome to my world.
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:42.460]  You seem to have a little bit of flurry of activity there.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:49.460]  I'll be at a brief signal there.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.460]  We'll get some messages there.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.460]  John's making reference to excuse me.
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:59.460]  His choice track would be loving a boy's adventure tale.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:03.460]  That's a terrific track.
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:09.460]  The time like I say I was into the more.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.460]  I'm going to go off the golf scene.
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.460]  But I do remember that track.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:18.460]  It's good.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.460]  You know, I'll make a point.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.460]  You visit that album.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.460]  Maybe older and wise are not the rest.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.460]  Somewhat differently.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.460]  I don't know.
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.460]  I don't know.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.460]  Like I say.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.460]  I haven't said it.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.460]  I had a couple of text there as well.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.460]  It's still sticking on.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.460]  He says what a beautiful version of take on me.
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:45.460]  It's not just reimagined.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.460]  It's like a different song.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.460]  It's the same song.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:52.460]  Then he followed it up there with a gentleman.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.460]  Jim Reeves, of course he's talking about the other.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:00.460]  Who we just played just back to back there with the Connie Francis track there.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.460]  I was welcomed to my world.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:05.460]  He goes on to say that it was a favourite of his late parents.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:09.460]  And it was also a favourite of his as well.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:13.460]  So I'm glad that a picture box there.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:17.460]  It's actually, it's kind of a bit of sweet really.
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.460]  Because that's song.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.460]  It means enough a lot to me.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.460]  For different reasons really at the time.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.460]  Many, many years ago.
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.460]  In fact, I'm going to go back to a specific instance.
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.460]  It was a bit...
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.460]  Goodness.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.460]  20.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:34.460]  If my wife is listening.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:35.460]  I won't get busted.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:36.460]  Many years ago.
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.460]  I need to get this right.
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.460]  I'll just say 20 plus years ago.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:45.460]  We moved into our new house.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.460]  It was all really exciting.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.460]  You know, I was just a young deaf lady.
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:51.460]  No experience in DIY at all.
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:52.460]  I have you saw.
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.460]  So there were says, I have, you know, my dad will help paint.
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.460]  And she qualified that.
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.460]  That helped paint actually means my dad will paint for you.
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.460]  Because I'm less than a paint production in all my days.
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:07.460]  It's just really, really wet behind the ears and all that kind of stuff.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.460]  So the agreement was he would deal with the upstairs.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.460]  And I would deal with the downstairs.
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:15.460]  My goodness.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.460]  I'm 30.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.460]  How much?
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.460]  For different reasons.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:22.460]  I just did not enjoy painting.
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.460]  Because it wasn't the act of painting itself.
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:26.460]  It was just...
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.460]  We joined coming around.
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:29.460]  We had to...
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:30.460]  I'm saying we, it was just me and him.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:31.460]  It was in the house, step up.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.460]  It was out in the messages or something.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.460]  I don't know.
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:39.460]  But I had to listen to his hockey dunk for several hours.
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.460]  That afternoon, in fact.
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:44.460]  And it had become a long run in joke for a long time.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.460]  But I like to say...
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.460]  I listen to that...
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.460]  With different aspects of it.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.460]  See it through different eyes.
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:54.460]  But listen to it completely different.
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.460]  Takes on a whole...
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:58.460]  Like I said earlier.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.460]  It's just that.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.460]  The wonderful thing about music,
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.460]  all these memories that have worked.
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.460]  Just wouldn't change it for the world.
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.460]  It's just...
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.460]  It's just...
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.460]  It's just...
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.460]  It's just...
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.460]  It's just...
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.460]  It's just...
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.460]  It's just...
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.460]  It's just...
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.460]  It's just...
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.460]  It's just...
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.460]  It's just...
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:26.460]  It's just...
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:27.460]  It's just...
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.460]  It's just...
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.460]  It's just...
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.460]  It's just...
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:31.460]  It's just...
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.460]  It's just...
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.460]  It's just...
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.460]  It's just...
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.460]  It's just...
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.460]  It's just...
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.460]  It's just...
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.460]  It's just...
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.460]  It's just...
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.460]  It's just...
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.460]  It's just...
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.460]  It's just...

[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:15.460]  It's the heart
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:21.460]  It's the heart
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:28.460]  It's the heart
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:34.460]  It's the heart
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:42.460]  It's the heart
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.460]  That was actually I was a jumpeal session by PG Harvey
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.460]  It was a track called Omeilover
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:54.460]  And that track ultimately ended up on the album Dry
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.460]  We back in 1990
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.460]  Little bit of them, I can remember
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.460]  1990s
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.460]  1990s something
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:05.460]  Anyway, and before the advert was there
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:08.460]  We had, you know, just like a CF
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.460]  Keith, if you're listening, I don't know
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.460]  Or if you're going to listen to the show and mix cloud
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:16.460]  The fact that I played those two back-to-back for you
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:18.460]  I was the first instrumental there
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:20.460]  That was the little fingers, go for it
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:23.460]  And then like I say, I do happen to know that
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:27.460]  That is your favourite mission track like a child again
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:30.460]  I did say earlier on the show that we've got three
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:32.460]  Three tracks by Scarlett Joy this evening
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.460]  And coming up we've got the second of those
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:39.460]  This is a track from the album
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:43.460]  Not the album called this track is called Rather
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:45.460]  This track is called Rescue
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:12.460]  Everything I come control
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:15.460]  Hold it on to the side
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:19.460]  Hold it on to the side
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:23.460]  Hold it on to the side
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:26.460]  Come to my side
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:31.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:38.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:42.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:43.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:45.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:50.460]  Hold it on to my side
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.460]  Motherland
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.460]  Motherland
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:05.060]  And I'll never know, I've got to let go
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:08.380]  And everything I can't control
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:12.500]  Holdin' on to the time
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:19.500]  Oh, holdin' on to the time
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:23.020]  You're in my dark
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:28.260]  I'm losing my mind, but I can't see anything
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:32.260]  Well, well, I think it's real
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:35.260]  Tell my one of them
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:38.260]  It's so true, while I'm running
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:41.260]  It's saying to everything
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:49.260]  Well, well, well, well, well
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:56.260]  Well, well, well, well, well, well, well
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:13.420]  Oh, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, be free
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:16.620]  God of my turn
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:20.260]  There is one of my mind I can't see anything
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:24.260]  I love you, I love you
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:28.260]  You say you don't know what I'm thinking
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:32.260]  But so do I love you
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.260]  Send to everything
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:38.260]  When we're all defeated
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:42.260]  You're in my time
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:47.260]  Look at my mind, the country and everything
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:51.260]  When we're all defeated
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.260]  You're in my time
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:57.260]  Look at my mind, the country and everything
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.260]  When we're all defeated
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:03.260]  Everything, when we're all defeated
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:07.260]  When we're all defeated
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:15.260]  When we're all defeated
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:31.260]  Everything, when we're all defeated
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:45.260]  That's Lincoln Band, Scarlett Joy, excuse me, and that was the second track
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:47.260]  From the album Morning
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:49.260]  Excuse me
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.260]  Excuse me
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.260]  That was the second track from the album
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:57.260]  Morning pages, Swiss back in November 2022
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:30:01.260]  There've not been written on the laurels at the back of that
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:05.260]  They have actually been busy writing and recording some new materials
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:09.260]  We're going to hear a new track just landed just the other week
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.260]  Real soon
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:13.260]  Talk a little bit more about them later on
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:15.260]  But for note
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.260]  This is, I've always struggled when I've played this band before
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.260]  Is it live or is it live?
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:21.260]  It's just the way that stylized
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:23.260]  There's an accent above the eye
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:27.260]  So I'm going to go with this band is called live
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.260]  This is a song
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.260]  Well, I guess it is
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:35.260]  This is a song from the album Songs from the Black Mountain
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:37.260]  This is a song
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:39.260]  How many times can I mention the one song
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:41.260]  This is a track
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:43.260]  Where to be cool from here
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.260]  I wanted a mountain
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:47.260]  It gave me sea
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:49.260]  I wanted a hurricane
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.260]  It gave me a breeze
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:53.260]  I wanted to run
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:55.260]  Mimmy standing free
[01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.260]  I wanted to dream
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:03.260]  You made me sleep
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:05.260]  I wanted to touch the bottom
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.260]  It was too deep
[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:09.260]  I wanted a revolution
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.260]  It said I was already free
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.260]  Oh
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.260]  Yeah
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:17.260]  We'll do it
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:19.260]  Go from here
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:21.260]  Now the day is gone
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:25.260]  I'll do it

[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:31.260]  With nothing in our face
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.260]  We'll do it
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.260]  Go from here
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:39.260]  Now the night has gone
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:41.260]  I wanted to touch
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.260]  You made me sleep
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:45.260]  I wanted to run
[01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:47.260]  A new place to start
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:49.260]  I wanted to catch
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.260]  You live

[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:22.260]  I'll do it
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:24.540]  I'll do it
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:25.260]  I'll do it
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:30.260]  I'm singing now, baby
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:33.260]  Where do we go from here?
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:38.260]  Now the night has come out
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:44.260]  How do we face our fears?
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:47.260]  Where do we go?
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:52.260]  Where do we go?
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:57.260]  Where do we go?
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:02.260]  Where do we go?
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:26.260]  Where do we go from here?
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:31.260]  I've unwittingly picked quite an up title really
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:33.260]  When I was putting this playlist together
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:35.260]  And genuinely this was not deliberate
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:38.260]  Because the next track coming up
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:40.260]  I really really was torn
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:42.260]  Should I play it?
[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:43.260]  Should I not?
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:44.260]  Should I?
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.260]  I don't know
[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:47.260]  And so I went off on to dinner.
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:50.260]  I've done a fair bit of reading and research
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:53.260]  I mean, first of all, it's our dry read
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:55.260]  But it's open to so much interpretation
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.260]  The off-comrails
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:00.260]  There isn't, I've wanted so badly to play this song
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:02.260]  But it does drop the F-ball minute
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:05.260]  My interpretation and I'm not going to play
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:07.260]  In case the station manager was listening to me
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:10.260]  Okay, because I kind of figured that I'd do it
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:13.260]  I'm a jacket maybe on a bit of a shaky nail
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:18.260]  But my interpretation of it is that if it's after the water shed
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:21.260]  It does actually say, and it's all about context
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:24.260]  You could get away with it
[01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:26.260]  You know, this is the whole thing
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:29.260]  It's all entirely subjective and somebody might
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:33.260]  Well, the station manager might interpret it completely differently
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.260]  You know, and I thought, do you know what?
[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:38.260]  The fact that I'm even looking at this is just this classic thing
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.260]  If you've got to say it's not, it may be better or not
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.260]  So what I'm going to do is
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:45.260]  I'm going to leave a note in the show notes
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:48.260]  I'm not encouraging you to go off and listen to it
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:51.260]  Now, please do stick around for the next 20 minutes or so
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:57.260]  Because this next track is really, really good as well
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:36:00.260]  It's just, it's just not really the one I wanted to play
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:04.260]  The one I wanted to play now, I need to take a deep breath
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:06.260]  To get this out and I catch you not
[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:13.260]  This, it's got, I mean, it must be the longest album title
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.260]  There's ever been made, you know, I'm sure some day
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:19.260]  If there are clips and again as booker records
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.260]  It can maybe keep me right
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:22.260]  But I'm going to have a stab at this in one breath
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:26.260]  The title, the track that I wanted to play is called Get Gone
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:30.260]  I mean, it's just, like I say, it's absolutely terrific
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:31.260]  It really, really is
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:33.260]  And it was a bifu and apple
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:35.260]  And it's from the album
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:38.260]  When the pond hits the conflict, he thinks like a king
[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:40.260]  What he knows throws the blows
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:43.260]  When he goes to the fight and he'll win the whole thing
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.260]  For he enters the ring, there's nobody
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:48.260]  There's nobody to battle
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:51.260]  When your mind is your might, so when you go solo
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:53.260]  You, I'm not finished yet
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:57.260]  You hold your own hand and remember that depth is the greatest of heights
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:01.260]  And if you know where do you stand, then you know where to land
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:05.260]  And if you fall it will matter because you know that you're right
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.260]  Understandably, that album
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:12.260]  It's more commonly known as when the pond dot dot dot
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.260]  That's quite a mouthful
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:16.260]  It really is
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:19.260]  But like I said, I'll leave a link in the show notes
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:20.260]  Because he's to check it out
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:23.260]  Please don't go off
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:28.260]  On to other socials, YouTube or whatever your social music from
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:31.260]  Please just do stick around for the next 20 minutes
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:34.260]  Because that's, well, in my opinion
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:36.260]  It's not as strong as get gone
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:38.260]  It's every bit as good
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:41.260]  And it's from the album that was thankfully
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.260]  It's called Extraordinary Machine
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.260]  So it's not quite the mouthful
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:47.260]  But it really for a long time
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:49.260]  It was the album that almost never was
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:52.260]  Because the record company had shelved it
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:55.260]  When it was originally recorded
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.260]  It mixed down the record execs
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:01.260]  For whatever reason thought it's not commercial enough
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:02.260]  And it was shelved for a long time
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:05.260]  And then there was a campaign to try and
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:08.260]  In this predates socials and what have you
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:10.260]  So the significance of this campaign
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:11.260]  Can't be understated
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:14.260]  But there was a kind of internet campaign
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:16.260]  Back then it was all about news groups
[01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:19.260]  And what have you taken a free few enough from
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.260]  In fact, I think it might have been cold free few enough
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:24.260]  But it was free enough from the shackles of our record company
[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:29.260]  But in a rather bizarre twist of
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:30.260]  Trist of faith
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.260]  The record company
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.260]  Relanted to a degree
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.260]  If you like, albeit the said right UK
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:37.260]  You can do the album
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:39.260]  But you're going to have to re-record a lot
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:41.260]  Remix and get another producer
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:42.260]  And to do it
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:44.260]  And so for a long time
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:47.260]  There was two versions of the same album
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:49.260]  But they're completely different
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.260]  Circulating
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:53.260]  I unfortunately because they are the other ones
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.260]  They were leaked
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:55.260]  They were leaked on the internet
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.260]  And it's just bootleg copies that exist
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:59.260]  There was never officially released
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:00.260]  So I don't have that copy
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:04.260]  I've got the what became the official record company release
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.260]  From the album Extraordinary Machine
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:08.260]  This is a track called Window
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:24.260]  Time you was talking to me
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:27.260]  It was a filthy pain
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:28.260]  Of glass
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:32.260]  I couldn't get a clear view
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.260]  And as he went
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:36.260]  All alone
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:38.260]  It wasn't the outside world
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:40.260]  I could see
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:43.260]  Just the filthy pain
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:48.260]  That I was looking through
[01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:52.260]  So I had to break the window
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:56.260]  It just had to be
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:59.260]  Better that I break the window
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:03.260]  Than him or her or me
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:07.260]  I was never focused on just one thing
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.260]  My eyes got fixed
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:12.260]  When my mind got so
[01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:15.260]  And they look like I'm contented
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:20.260]  On a very clear view
[01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:23.260]  But I'm as good as I sleep
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:27.260]  I bet you didn't know
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:30.260]  I take a lot of it away
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:33.260]  If you do
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:39.260]  I had to break the window
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:43.260]  It just had to be
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:47.260]  Better that I break the window
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:50.260]  Than him or her or me
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:55.260]  I had to break the window
[01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:58.260]  It just had to be
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.260]  It wasn't my way
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:03.260]  Better that I break the window
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:07.260]  Then forget what I had to say
[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:10.260]  Unless what I should say
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:18.260]  Because the fact would be in there
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:20.260]  Whatever's in front of me
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:22.260]  It's color in my view
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:26.260]  So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:31.260]  I only see what I'm looking through
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:44.260]  So again I've done the right thing
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:48.260]  I was never worried about that
[01:41:48.260 --> 01:42:06.260]  The answer's always been in the preview
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:13.260]  But even when the windows clean
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:16.260]  Nice to fancy for the fact
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:20.260]  That when it's clean it's so clear
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:24.260]  I can't tell what I'm looking through
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:29.260]  So I had to break the window
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:32.260]  It just had to be
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:34.260]  It wasn't my way
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:37.260]  Better that I break the window
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:41.260]  Than him or her or me
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:45.260]  I had to break the window
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.260]  It just had to be
[01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:50.260]  It wasn't my way
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:53.260]  Better that I break the window
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:57.260]  Then this what I should say
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:43:01.260]  I had to break the window
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:04.260]  It just had to be
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:05.260]  It wasn't my way
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:08.260]  Better that I break the window
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:12.260]  Then forget what I had to say
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:16.260]  Unless what I should say
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:20.260]  I'll break my heart on me
[01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:23.260]  Especially me
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:35.260]  Better that I break the window
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:40.260]  It just had to be
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:44.260]  It just had to be
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:48.260]  Better that I break the window
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.260]  It just had to be
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:54.260]  It just had to be
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.260]  It just had to be
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:59.260]  It just had to be
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:01.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:03.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:05.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:09.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:11.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:13.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:16.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:17.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:19.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:20.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:21.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:22.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:23.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:24.260]  It just had to be
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:38.260]  You know where that was playing?
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:40.260]  I was just coming from John
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:42.260]  John says he must have
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:44.260]  He really must check out
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:46.260]  He really enjoyed that track
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:47.260]  And he's
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:49.260]  He's glad to know
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:52.260]  I'm glad that I'm not alone in
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:53.260]  Thinking that because
[01:44:53.260 --> 01:45:01.260]  ever come to this side of the pond, I would pick good money to go and see her. But the chances
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:08.380]  I think of getting to see her are pretty slim, really. But I can't know if, yeah, without going
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:15.020]  into the detail, she's got quite a quite a backstory. Yeah, maybe I've had an exercise after
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:20.460]  the show. You can kind of read into it. I'm not sure if I could even repeat a lot of it on the
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:27.900]  show, such as the nature of it, it's quite a traumatic upbringing and she's had and, you know,
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:33.100]  putting in a positive spin or if you like it, translates into some absolutely terrific music,
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:37.580]  because that's where I think a lot of it comes from. And if you're going to check some stuff out,
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:41.820]  she's actually had, I haven't got around to get in this yet, she had an album that was released,
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:47.820]  I think it was just before Covid breakouts with what would that be, but 2020,
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:54.540]  an album called Fetched The Book Cutters. So I can't comment on that, but the album that preceded it,
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:46:01.580]  that was the last album I bought. Okay, that was a bit of a word day title. I don't have
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:06.140]  not going to, I'm just in the interest, I've time, I'm not going to write a lot of the entire title,
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:13.580]  but that became known as the idler wheel. That could be a bit of a challenging lesson.
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:20.540]  It's good, but really for me, Fiona Apple, for beginners, there's two albums that you really
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:27.180]  ought to gravitate to. The album that we just had, or the album that that track was lifted from,
[01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:33.020]  that we just listened to, extra-ordinary machine, or like I say, when the point. And that was
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:39.980]  certainly the first album that I came across back in 1999 when that was released. Some of the
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:43.900]  brought it into work, so you have a lesson to this. I thought that's absolutely brilliant.
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:48.140]  And like I say, you get going for me, there's a lot of really, really strong tracks in that,
[01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:54.220]  but there's just something about the key changes in what have you in the piano, it's just really,
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:47:00.620]  really good. Anyway, I talked about a abbreviating album titles in the interests of time,
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:05.100]  I'm looking at 10 to 10, and they're making us, we've still got quite a few tracks to
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:11.580]  kind of squeeze on before 10, but I'll do my very, very best, and we'll start with this. This is
[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:37.740]  End your Fesh.
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:48:10.580]  It's suffocating, the kiss is baby, suffocating me with a burning love, suffocating me with chains around me, suffocating me with a first bit die.
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:16.580]  It's suffocating me with a rebirth.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:28.580]  It's suffocating me with a conversation, suffocating me with a set of words, suffocating me with a set of love, suffocating me with a set of love.
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:34.580]  So, for keeping me with you close for us
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:44.580]  I love you, you're so religious
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:48.580]  I get a thrill in the curtain calls
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:52.580]  I feel like a wrong candle
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:58.580]  Do you still fall in love for us?
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:05.580]  So, keep me with you
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:44.580]  I love you, I love you, I love you
[01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:50.580]  I love you, I love you
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:58.580]  I don't know what to do
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:02.580]  So, keep me with you
[01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:06.580]  So, keep me with you
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:12.580]  So, keep me with you
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:56.580]  If there was ever a story to be told about being at the right place at the right time, you'd just heard that
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:58.580]  That was Angel Fish and suffocate me
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:04.580]  And for those who don't know Angel Fish was really good by him as a McKenzie
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:08.580]  I'm just with a different singer, Shirley Manson
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:13.580]  But rather, man, make up, took a bit of a backstage, back step rather
[01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:19.580]  And allow Shirley Manson to take vocals on that, which was really just a side project
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:23.580]  And the music video for that suffocate me was just once
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:30.580]  In the early, the small hours, the small hours on a kind of just unsain bands kind of thing
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:35.580]  On MTV and the Butchfig happened to be watching it, caught that
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:39.580]  And the rest of the series has to be Shirley left
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:45.580]  Shirley left McKenzie and went on to join, joined Garbage
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:51.580]  And, yeah, but shortly after, Shirley after that, rather, I could buy Mr McKenzie
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:54.580]  I know that I know that they're still kicking around
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:52:00.580]  Really, they did decide to call it a day and I couldn't as I can't remember the late 90s
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:07.580]  They decided to call it a day, but they reformed really to just, it was always going to be a one-off gig
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:12.580]  At the barrel and to mark the 30th anniversary of that debut album
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:18.580]  Could dig in dirty rags, but after that I've been sold out, and the interest
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:23.580]  You know, they could just see the interest hadn't waned in the band
[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:27.580]  So they reformed, and they're still playing, and they're the ones that were actually playing
[01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:31.580]  Didn't, didn't wrap a whole festival there, just did the weekend
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:36.580]  And I've seen some photos and yeah, there's a lot of people that are going to see them
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:41.580]  And they've been down really well, so there's lots of, it's pretty much the same band
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:47.580]  You've got their Kelly on drums, their runa scobies back in the fold on keyboards
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:51.580]  Big John, John Duncan on guitars, Matt Mecca, of course
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:55.580]  On vocals and their jump ready is also in a hand in
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:53:01.580]  Linda, hand in hand, a helping hand, rather, on guitars
[01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:07.580]  And if what I've read is, is true, he also took a played there
[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:11.580]  Now if you know this track, it will mean something to you, he played the female part
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:19.580]  And the track, normal boy, which was performed at that during that gig, a normal boy
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:24.580]  It's a bit of a kind of chat and response thing, it's a boy and they're originally
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:29.580]  It was a Shirley Manson, obviously playing the girl part, and they might make a cuff
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:34.580]  That boy, so back for the occasion of the weekend there, it was by our kids
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:40.580]  Like I say, it was Jim Brady, that was taking vocals there
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:47.580]  Now the talk I'll be very briefly about the final gig, I got that, I think it's very real
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:51.580]  Because I've never seen it anywhere, and it's like hence teeth
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:56.580]  And when it comes up on an auction site, oh my goodness
[01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:04.580]  An auction site, I did not mean to say that, I just, my mouth can't keep up with my brain
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:08.580]  And that's why that naughty world came out there
[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:14.580]  Oh dear, I mean, I should've just went with it and just played that, I feel an apple
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:20.580]  You know what, anyway, an auction site
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:27.580]  Yeah, you could expect to pay a pretty penny for this version of the CD that I have
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:31.580]  Because it was a bit like a fire sale really
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:36.580]  During the last gig, it was just like everything, I was just, it was all I could do
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:40.580]  Like four at a time, about the T-shirts, about a couple of T-shirts
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:45.580]  So I bought a VHS video, which was absolutely terrific, it was just full of promo videos
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:49.580]  And I get the glass go at the green when they're supporting blondie
[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:54.580]  Lots of other stuff, but I also got this as a curious release
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:59.580]  Because it had no front cover, but it had the back cover
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:04.580]  And it's like misprinted as well, and I think this is why it's maybe worth a bit of cash
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:10.580]  And yeah, it was just like, like I say, it was a CD, there's a track from that album
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:16.580]  And it was only like I say, it was never ever for sale, it was only released or sorry
[01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:22.580]  It was only for sale, rather, at that final gig, and yeah, like I say, hence teeth
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:27.580]  From that album, the glory hole, this is called House on Fire
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:47.580]  You'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light
[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:52.580]  You'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:55.580]  You'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:58.580]  You'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:56:03.580]  You'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:07.580]  You'll see the light, you'll see the light
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:17.580]  You'll see the light, you'll see the light, you'll see the light
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:47.580]  Get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:57:17.580]  off, get off, get off, get off,
[01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:47.580]  get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, not until now
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:47.580]  I'm going to show you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
[01:58:47.580 --> 01:59:17.580]  little bit of
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:35.360]  a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of an amount of a little bit of just a little bit.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:40.720]  From the album glory hall, that was good buying Mr McKenzie.
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:46.920]  I'm conscious that I've all of a run just to be able to slay there but I've got two tracks to go.
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:52.920]  Um, but you know, uh, yeah, just I'm just going to roll with it.
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:57.160]  I'm all ready on the naughty step, um, you know, probably get a yellow card for that.
[01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:04.440]  We oopsie earlier on. So, uh, yeah, just to keep the off-completes happy, sorry about that, um, you
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:09.560]  know, it's, uh, it's incredible. It's only earlier. I was talking about how you can see this
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:14.680]  and you can see that, uh, you know, after my interpretation of reading the off-com
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:20.040]  guidelines about that track, get going with a few an apple and then then a go and drop a
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:25.400]  clanger. Uh, that's live radio for a year, suppose, isn't it? Anyway, back to the music. Um, we're
[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:31.640]  all ready over running, um, and, um, you know, I'm not helping the cause by just babbling on. So,
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:37.400]  I did say that I was going to feature three tracks by Scarlett Joy and I've far from my money. I've
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:45.560]  saved the very best, um, to last. This, uh, this record, this track. Well, yeah, the single came out,
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:51.880]  uh, just last week, uh, and it was really, I was a promoter that pointed me to, uh, just on Friday,
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:56.120]  picked it up on set. It's picked the messes up and sat out there and I was like, oh, that's just,
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:01.560]  that just fits the mold of this show, just absolutely perfect. And, uh, honest with
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:08.840]  the goodness, I've lost count of the amount of times that, um, that I've played it. Um, so, just
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:13.960]  absolutely dying to share it with you all tonight. So, uh, yeah, for the first time play on here
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:23.960]  on East Coast FM, this is Scarlett Joy. And, uh, then a single back for more.
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:49.960]  I've run from here, oh, you've tried to.
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:43.960]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:03:13.960]  uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh um uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh dat uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:18.460]  Get coming, I'll get coming back to you
[02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:28.460]  Oh, here we go
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:32.460]  Speaking of time, is it yours?
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:37.960]  Oh, now I know, let's put on the arms
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:43.460]  And it goes, oh, oh
[02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:47.460]  Speaking of time, is it yours?
[02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:53.460]  Oh, now I know, let's put on the arms
[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:58.460]  And it goes, oh
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:06.460]  So I didn't think of anything
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:14.960]  So I didn't go on and all, so I shouldn't have faith
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:32.700]  And all I know, I don't know, if I'm sure don't

[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:38.140]  to reveal this. There's actually going to be one more single that's going to be released on September
[02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:45.500]  the second just before the EP eventually drops and when that EP does land I will release some
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:52.380]  information you know on the Sunday Insessions Facebook page where you can get copies of that because
[02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:58.300]  I'm likely to believe that there's likely going to be a limited edition run some CDs and possibly
[02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:08.140]  even you know this said very much text my box some of the vinyl pressing of the EP but I guess we'll
[02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:13.580]  just have the second see what's this piece like I say as soon as soon as I know anything I will
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:18.140]  I will share it across the areas with you but one another piece of information that I can share
[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:23.020]  and I'll leave a second to an information in the show notes is that the next gig they've got
[02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:28.220]  lined up there is a plan at the economics festival down in Lincolnshire and that's it on
[02:06:28.220 --> 02:06:34.300]  the 21st of September. So if you're down in that neck you would say I do encourage you to go and
[02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:38.860]  go and check them out because I could have been I've been listening to I mean that I think that
[02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:44.620]  single is brilliant but it just encourage me to go and check out the back catalogue and it just doesn't
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:53.660]  disappoint. Anyway my goodness 10 past 10 I think I just need to wrap things up here and
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:58.780]  I just bit before I do though I just want to thank everybody who's taking the time trouble to
[02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:06.220]  to message and into the studio I'm really really much appreciated it's great to know that you're
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:11.660]  not all still there for me. I never ever take the regular lessons for granted like I say I thought
[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:16.700]  that you may have drifted away after watching Love Island and what have you and you're not
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:24.380]  Apple Jacks I'm still wrestling me in technology you know it's certainly not working working
[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:29.100]  from it and I I still can't get on to my Facebook I'm relying on all these messages it's really
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:32.860]  all of them getting the notifications on my I just have to have a quick glance in my watch
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:38.620]  see the notification just memorize it couldn't commit it to memory but if I have if I have
[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:44.700]  missed anything on there I do apologize and I'll hold me commands next week when I go home and
[02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:52.140]  kind of kind of kind of revisit post that I may have missed and I'll kind of write there on my ways
[02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:58.300]  and but for those who who want to kind of rinse and repeat as it were if they can't quite wait
[02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:04.140]  till next week I will be uploading the show to mix cloud over the next couple of days so yeah
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:10.060]  I'll like I say I'll drop a message on there on the sundown sessions Facebook page but if
