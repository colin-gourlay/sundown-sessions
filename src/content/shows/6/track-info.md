The band's lineup solidified with Echols on lead guitar, Lee on vocals and rhythm guitar, Bryan MacLean on guitar and vocals, Ken Forssi on bass, and Alban "Snoopy" Pfisterer on drums. His playing can be heard prominently on the band's seminal albums, particularly "Love" (1966), "Da Capo" (1966), and the critically acclaimed "Forever Changes" (1967). "Forever Changes" is often regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 1960s |
